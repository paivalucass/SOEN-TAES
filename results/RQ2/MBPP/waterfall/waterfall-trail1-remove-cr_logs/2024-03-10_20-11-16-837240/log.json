Additionally, it would be beneficial to include test cases where k is larger than the combined length of the input arrays.\\\",\\n  \\\"Developer\\\": \\\"As a Developer, I suggest revising the test cases to ensure that all possible scenarios are covered. This includes testing for boundary cases, such as when the input arrays have the maximum allowed length or when k is equal to the sum of the lengths of the input arrays. Additionally, it would be helpful to include test cases to check for proper handling of invalid input data, such as when the input arrays contain non-numeric values.\\\"\\n}\\n # Draft Test cases:\\n{\\n  \\\"test_cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Valid input arrays and k\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr1=[2, 3, 6, 7, 9], arr2=[1, 4, 8, 10], k=5\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"6\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Valid input arrays and k\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr1=[1, 3, 5, 7, 9], arr2=[2, 4, 6, 8, 10], k=7\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"7\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Valid input arrays and k\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr1=[1, 2, 3], arr2=[4, 5, 6], k=3\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"3\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Valid input arrays and k\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr1=[2, 3, 6, 7, 9], arr2=[1, 4, 8, 10], k=1\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"1\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction.
