Additionally, consider adding test cases for large input lists to check for performance and scalability.\\\",\\n  \\\"Developer\\\": \\\"As a Developer, I suggest revising the test cases to include more specific and descriptive expected outputs. For example, instead of just '16', the expected output for the first test case could be 'The sum of the lengths of all names in the input list should be 16'.
