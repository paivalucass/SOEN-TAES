Then, it should find the product of consecutive binomial coefficients and sum them up, returning the sum of the products as the output.\\n\\nHigh-level Design:\\n```python\\ndef binomial_Coeff(n, k):\\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Input parameter 'n' must be a positive integer\\\")\\n    # Implementation details to calculate binomial coefficient for 'n' and 'k'\\n    # ...\\n    return binomial_coefficient\\n\\ndef sum_Of_product(n):\\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Input parameter 'n' must be a positive integer\\\")\\n    \\n    product_sum = 0\\n    for k in range(n):\\n        product_sum += binomial_Coeff(n, k) * binomial_Coeff(n, k+1)\\n    return product_sum\\n\\n# Example usage\\nassert sum_Of_product(3) == 15\\n```\\n\\nThe new design includes error handling for the input parameter 'n' in both functions to ensure that it is a positive integer. Additionally, more test cases, including edge cases like n=0 and n=1, will be added to ensure the function handles all scenarios correctly.\", \"Question\": \"def binomial_Coeff(n,k): \\n'''Write a python function to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients.\\nassert sum_Of_product(3) == 15'''\\n\"}",
