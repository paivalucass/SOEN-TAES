The function should be implemented in Python and should be efficient and scalable for large input lists.

Additionally, input validation will be added to handle edge cases and invalid input more gracefully.\\n\\nThe approach for the function will use an efficient algorithm with low algorithmic complexity to merge the sublists. It will be optimized for scalability when merging large input lists.\\n\\nTest Cases:\\n- Functional Requirements:\\n  - Test Data: [['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]\\n  - Expected Results: [['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]\\n- Non-Functional Requirements:\\n  - Test Data:\\n    - Edge Cases:\\n      - Invalid input: empty list, lists with more than two elements\\n  - Expected Results:\\n    - Graceful handling of edge cases and invalid input\\n\\nAcceptance Criteria:\\n- Input: [['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]\\n- Expected Output: [['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]\\n\\nPython function:\\n\\n```python\\ndef merge(lst):\\n    if not all(isinstance(sublst, list) and len(sublst) == 2 for sublst in lst):\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Input must be a list of lists with two elements each\\\")\\n    \\n    result = [list(x) for x in zip(*lst)]\\n    return result\\n``` \\n\\nThis revised design takes into account the suggestions provided and ensures that the merge function is efficient, scalable, and handles edge cases and invalid input gracefully.\", \"Question\": \"def merge(lst):  \\n'''Write a python function which takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second.\\nassert merge([['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]) == [['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]'''\\n\"}",
