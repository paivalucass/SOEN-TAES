This will ensure that the code is able to handle extreme scenarios. Additionally, consider including test cases for edge cases, where the input data may be on the boundary of different categories (e.g. positive and negative values). This will help to ensure complete coverage of the input validation and calculation functionalities.\\\",\\n  \\\"Developer\\\": \\\"It would be helpful to revise the test cases by including more specific input data values and expected outputs. For example, instead of just stating 'various input arrays', provide specific arrays and the expected validation results. This will make it easier to understand the requirements and ensure that the test cases cover all possible scenarios. Additionally, consider including test cases for error handling, such as providing invalid input data and ensuring that the code handles it appropriately.\\\"\\n}\\n # Draft Test cases:\\n{\\n  \\\"test_cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Input Validation - Null Array\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=null,n=11\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"Handle null array input\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Input Validation - Zero Input Value\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=[100,10,5,25,35,14],n=0\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"Handle zero input value\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Input Validation - Various Input Arrays\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=[1,2,3,4],n=5\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"Ensure validation with various input arrays\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Calculation - Empty Array\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=[],n=11\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"Handle empty array input\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Calculation - Positive Integer Values\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=[2,3,4],n=5\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"Ensure calculation with positive integer values\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Calculation - Negative Integer Values\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=[-2,-3,-4],n=5\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"Ensure calculation with negative integer values\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Return - Valid Remainder\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=[100,10,5,25,35,14],n=11\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"Verify valid remainder value\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction.
