    "Original_architect_design": "Design:\n- Create a function called is_not_prime that takes an integer n as input.\n- Within the function, check if n is less than 2, and if so, return True indicating that it is not a prime number.\n- Use a for loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of n and check if n is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, return True indicating that it is not a prime number.\n- If the loop completes without finding a divisor, return False indicating that it is a prime number.\n- The function should include a unit test case to verify that is_not_prime(2) returns False.\n\nNote: This design provides an outline for the developer to follow when implementing the is_not_prime function without specifying the exact code details.",
