The function should return the angle of the complex number in radians. In addition to the specified requirements, the function should also include a description of the expected behavior, including any edge cases or special considerations, to create a more robust implementation. Specific test cases for edge cases, such as when the real or imaginary part is zero, should be added to ensure that the function handles these situations correctly. The implementation should use the math.isclose function to compare the result with the expected angle with a relative tolerance of 0.001.\\\",\\n  \\\"test_cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Non-zero real and imaginary parts\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=2,parameter2=3\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"0.982793723247329\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Zero real part\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=0,parameter2=5\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"1.5707963267948966\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Zero imaginary part\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=4,parameter2=0\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"0.0\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Both real and imaginary parts are zero\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=0,parameter2=0\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"0.0\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Both parts are negative\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=-4,parameter2=-3\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"-2.158798930342464\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Large input values\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=1000000000,parameter2=1000000000\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"0.7853981633974483\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Small input values\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=0.0000000001,parameter2=0.0000000001\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"0.7853981633974483\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"def angle_complex(a,b):\\n'''Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.\\nassert math.isclose(angle_complex(0,1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)'''\\n\"}",
