    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\nThe function median_numbers(a, b, c) should take three numerical inputs and return the median value of the three numbers. The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. If there are two middle numbers, the median is the average of those two numbers.\n\nThe developer should first sort the three input numbers in ascending order. Then, if the number of inputs is odd, the median will be the middle number. If the number of inputs is even, the median will be the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nThe function should return the median as a floating point number.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\ndef median_numbers(a, b, c):\n    nums = [a, b, c]\n    nums.sort()\n    if len(nums) % 2 != 0:\n        return float(nums[len(nums) // 2])\n    else:\n        return float((nums[len(nums) // 2 - 1] + nums[len(nums) // 2]) / 2)\n```\n\nThis high-level design guides the developer in sorting the input numbers and calculating the median based on the number of inputs.",
    "DesignMeetings": "{\n  \"Developer\": \"The current implementation looks good, but we should add some error handling to ensure that the input values are numerical. We can also consider using a different sorting algorithm for better performance if the input size is expected to be large.\",\n  \"Tester\": \"As a tester, I would validate the function with various test cases including odd and even number of inputs, negative numbers, and edge cases like identical inputs. I would also check for any potential floating point precision issues when calculating the average of two middle numbers.\"\n}",
    "Design": "New Design:\n\nBased on the suggestions provided, the new design for the function median_numbers(a, b, c) will include the following updates:\n\n1. Error Handling: The function will include error handling to ensure that the input values are numerical. This will be done by validating the input values to ensure they are numerical before proceeding with the sorting and median calculation.\n\n2. Sorting Algorithm: The function will use a different sorting algorithm for better performance if the input size is expected to be large. This will improve the efficiency of the sorting process, especially for larger input sets.\n\n3. Testing and Validation: The function will be validated with various test cases including odd and even number of inputs, negative numbers, and edge cases like identical inputs. Additionally, potential floating point precision issues when calculating the average of two middle numbers will be checked and addressed.\n\n4. Return Type: The function will continue to return the median as a floating point number.\n\nThe updated design will ensure that the function not only calculates the median accurately but also handles different input scenarios and potential precision issues.",
