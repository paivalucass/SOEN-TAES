Additionally, testing for edge cases such as negative numbers or very large numbers would be important.\"\n}",
    "Design": "Based on the suggestions provided by my colleagues, I have made the following changes to the draft version design:\n\n- Revised the function name from `cummulative_sum` to `calculate_cumulative_sum` to better reflect its purpose.\n- Incorporated a for loop to iterate through the list of tuples and calculate the sum of values in each tuple, as suggested by the developer.\n- Implemented thorough testing with different input lists of tuples, including empty lists, lists with single and multiple tuples, and lists with tuples containing different types of values (e.g., integers, floats), as well as testing for edge cases such as negative numbers or very large numbers, as suggested by the tester.\n\nOverall, these modifications enhance the functionality and reliability of the design.",
