    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n- Create a function called len_log that takes a list of strings as input.\n- Initialize a variable max_len to keep track of the maximum length encountered.\n- Iterate through the list of strings and for each string, calculate its length using the len() function.\n- If the length of the current string is greater than max_len, update max_len with the length of the current string.\n- After iterating through all the strings, return max_len as the result.\n\nThis design provides a high-level approach to solving the problem of finding the length of the longest word in a list of strings. It guides the developer to create a function that iterates through the list and keeps track of the maximum length encountered without providing specific implementation details.",
