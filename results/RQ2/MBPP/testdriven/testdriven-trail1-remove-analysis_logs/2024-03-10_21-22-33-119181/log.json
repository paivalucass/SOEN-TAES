    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\nThe count_Pairs function should take a list of integers as input and return the count of possible unordered pairs where both elements are unequal. \n\nThe function should iterate through the list and use a dictionary to store the count of each unique integer. Then, it should calculate the count of pairs using the combination formula for unordered pairs. Finally, the function should return the count of pairs.\n\nHigh-level code structure:\n```python\ndef count_Pairs(arr, n):\n    pairs_count = 0\n    # Use a dictionary to store the count of each unique integer in the list\n    count_dict = {}\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in count_dict:\n            count_dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[num] = 1\n\n    # Calculate the count of pairs using the combination formula for unordered pairs\n    for num, count in count_dict.items():\n        pairs_count += (count * (n - count))\n\n    return pairs_count // 2\n```\n\nThis high-level design provides guidance for the developer on how to structure the code and approach the problem, without getting into specific implementation details.",
