Otherwise, return False\n\nGuidance for developer:\n- Use a simple loop to iterate and check if the number is a perfect square\n- Utilize the property that a perfect square is the square of an integer\n- Validate the solution against test cases to ensure accuracy and efficiency\n\nNote: The developer should focus on creating an efficient and accurate algorithm to determine whether a given number is a perfect square. The implementation should be tested against various input cases to verify correctness.",
