    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\nThe design for the number_of_substrings function should take a string as input and return the count of non-empty substrings. \n\nHere are the high-level steps for implementing the function:\n1. Define a function number_of_substrings that takes a string as input.\n2. Initialize a variable count to 0 to keep track of the number of substrings.\n3. Use a nested loop to iterate through the string and consider all possible substrings.\n4. Increment the count for each non-empty substring encountered.\n5. Return the final count of non-empty substrings.\n\nThis design provides a clear outline for the developer to follow when implementing the number_of_substrings function. It focuses on the high-level logic and steps involved in solving the problem, rather than providing specific implementation details.",
