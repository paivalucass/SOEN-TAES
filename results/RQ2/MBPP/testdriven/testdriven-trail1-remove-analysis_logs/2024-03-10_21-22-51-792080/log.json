    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\nObjective:\nThe objective of the function two_unique_nums(nums) is to remove duplicate numbers from a given list of numbers and return a new list containing only the unique numbers.\n\nApproach:\n1. Iterate through the input list of numbers.\n2. Create an empty list to store unique numbers.\n3. For each number in the input list, check if it has already been added to the unique numbers list. If not, add it to the list.\n4. Return the list of unique numbers.\n\nPseudocode:\n```\nfunction two_unique_nums(nums):\n    unique_nums = []\n    for num in nums:\n        if num not in unique_nums:\n            unique_nums.append(num)\n    return unique_nums\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe function two_unique_nums(nums) takes a list of numbers as input and iterates through the list to identify and store unique numbers in a separate list. The use of a conditional check ensures that only unique numbers are added to the unique_nums list. Finally, the list of unique numbers is returned as the output.\n\nThis high-level design provides a clear and concise approach for the developer to implement the function, focusing on the logic and algorithm rather than specific implementation details.",
    "DesignMeetings": "{\n  \"Developer\": \"As a developer, I would suggest adding error handling to the function two_unique_nums(nums) to handle cases where the input is not a list of numbers.

If not, add it to the list.\n4.

This will improve the robustness of the function and make it more reliable.\n\nComments:\nIn line with the developer's suggestion, I have also added comments to the code to improve readability and maintainability. This will make it easier for other developers to understand and modify the code in the future.\n\nTesting:\nIn response to the tester's suggestion, I will create test cases to cover scenarios such as an empty input list, a list with all duplicate numbers, and a list with no duplicate numbers.
