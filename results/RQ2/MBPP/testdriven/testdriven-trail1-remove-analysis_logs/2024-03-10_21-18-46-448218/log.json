Sum the cubes together to obtain the final result.\n\nThe function should be designed to handle positive integer inputs and should return the cube sum as an integer.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef cube_Sum(n):\n    # Write your code here\n```\n\nPlease note that the above example is intentionally left blank for the developer to fill in the implementation details.
