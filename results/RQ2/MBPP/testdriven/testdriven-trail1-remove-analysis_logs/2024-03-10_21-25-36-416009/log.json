    "DesignDraft": "Design:\nThe swap_List function should take a single parameter, newList, which is a list of elements. The function should return a new list with the first and last elements interchanged.\n\nThe high-level algorithm for the swap_List function can be as follows:\n1. Check if the newList is empty. If it is, return an empty list.\n2. Create a new list, result, and add the last element of newList to result.\n3. Iterate through the elements of newList, adding each element (except the first and last) to result.\n4. Add the first element of newList to result.\n5. Return the result list.\n\nThis design provides a high-level overview of the algorithm for the swap_List function, allowing the developer to understand the logic and implement the code accordingly.",

    "Design": "Based on the suggestions, the new design for the swap_List function should include additional considerations for edge cases and thorough testing. The function should be able to handle cases where the newList has only one element and ensure that the swapping is done correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the testing should include various inputs such as an empty list, a list with only one element, and a list with multiple elements to ensure the function behaves as expected in different scenarios.\n\nThe high-level algorithm for the swap_List function should be updated to include handling of edge cases such as when the newList has only one element. The algorithm should be modified to handle these cases appropriately and ensure that the function works as intended in all scenarios.\n\nOverall, the new design should prioritize robustness and thorough testing to ensure the reliability and correctness of the swap_List function.",
