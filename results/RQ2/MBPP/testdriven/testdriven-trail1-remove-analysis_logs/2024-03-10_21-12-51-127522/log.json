    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n- The function all_Bits_Set_In_The_Given_Range should take three parameters: n, l, and r representing the number n and the range [l, r].\n- Inside the function, first, we need to create a bitmask with all the bits set in the given range [l, r].\n- Then, we can use the bitwise AND operation to check if all the bits in the given range are unset (i.e., the result of the bitwise AND operation is 0).\n- Finally, the function should return True if all the bits are unset in the given range and False otherwise.\n\nThis design focuses on providing a high-level guide for the developer to implement the function using the bitwise operations and the concept of bit manipulation. It does not provide specific implementation details like variable names or exact code.",
