It should return a new string with all words of length K removed from the input string.\n\nHere are the high-level steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Split the input string into individual words.\n2. Iterate over each word and check its length.\n3. If the length of the word is equal to K, remove it from the list of words.\n4. Join the remaining words into a new string.\n5. Return the new string as the result.\n\nThis design provides a clear and high-level guide for the developer to implement the remove_length function without diving into specific implementation details.",
