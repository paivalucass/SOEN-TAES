    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\nFunction Name: capital_words_spaces\n\nInput: str1 (string) - The given input string\n\nOutput: str (string) - The modified string with spaces between words starting with capital letters\n\nDescription: The capital_words_spaces function takes a string as input and modifies it by adding spaces between words starting with capital letters. The function iterates through the input string and identifies the positions of capital letters to insert spaces. The modified string is then returned as the output.\n\nPseudocode:\n1. Initialize an empty string variable to store the modified string.\n2. Iterate through each character in the input string.\n3. If a capital letter is encountered, check if it is the first character of a word.\n4. If it is the first character of a word, add a space before the capital letter.\n5. Append the character to the modified string.\n6. Return the modified string.\n\nGuidelines for implementation:\n- Use a loop to iterate through the characters of the input string.\n- Use a conditional statement to check if a character is a capital letter and if it is the first character of a word.\n- Use string concatenation or a list to build the modified string with added spaces.\n\nNote: This design provides a high-level overview of the approach to be taken in implementing the function. Actual implementation details may vary based on the programming language and specific requirements of the development environment.",
    "DesignMeetings": "{\n  \"Developer\": \"The design looks good overall. One suggestion would be to include some error handling for cases where the input string is empty or null. Additionally, consider adding some validation to ensure that the input string contains actual words and not just random capital letters. This will help improve the robustness of the function.\",\n  \"Tester\": \"As a tester, I would recommend conducting thorough testing for various input scenarios, including empty strings, strings with only one word, strings with multiple words, and strings with special characters. Also, consider testing for edge cases such as strings with consecutive capital letters or strings with non-letter characters. This will help ensure that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.\"\n}",
    "Design": "Based on the suggestions provided by the developer and tester, the new design for the capital_words_spaces function will include the following updates:\n\n1. Error Handling:\n   - Include error handling for cases where the input string is empty or null.\n   - Add validation to ensure that the input string contains actual words and not just random capital letters.\n\n2. Thorough Testing:\n   - Conduct thorough testing for various input scenarios, including empty strings, strings with only one word, strings with multiple words, and strings with special characters.\n   - Test for edge cases such as strings with consecutive capital letters or strings with non-letter characters to ensure the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.\n\n3.
