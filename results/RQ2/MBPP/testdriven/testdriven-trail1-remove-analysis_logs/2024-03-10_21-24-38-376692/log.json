    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\nThe radian_degree function should take in a parameter degree, which represents the angle in degrees. The function should then convert the degree to radians using the formula radians = degrees * (pi / 180). The result should be returned as the output of the function.\n\nThis function should be designed to handle the conversion of degrees to radians for any given input. It should also include a validation step to ensure that the output matches the expected result, such as using an assertion statement to check if radian_degree(90) returns 1.5707963267948966.\n\nAdditionally, the function should be well-documented to explain its purpose and usage, including any potential edge cases or constraints to consider when using the function. This documentation will help guide the developer in understanding the function's behavior and how to use it appropriately.",
