This function should take a single parameter s, which represents the input string to be checked.\n\nThe high-level design of the function should involve iterating through the characters of the input string and comparing each character with the first character of the string. If any character is found to be different from the first character, the function should return False, indicating that not all characters are the same.\n\nThe design should also include the use of the assert statement to validate the function's correctness by providing an example usage and expected output. In this case, the design should include the assertion assert all_Characters_Same(\"python\") == False to demonstrate the expected behavior of the function.\n\nOverall, the design should focus on guiding the developer in writing the code for the all_Characters_Same function, emphasizing the logic and approach to be taken rather than specific implementation details.",
