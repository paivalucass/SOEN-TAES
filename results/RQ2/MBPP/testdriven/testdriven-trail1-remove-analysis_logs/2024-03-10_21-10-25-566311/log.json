It should return the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating the binary string 's' the given number of times 'n'.\n\nThe high-level design for this function should include the following steps:\n1. Convert the binary string 's' to an integer value.\n2. Define a function to rotate the binary string by a given number of times 'n'.\n3. Inside the rotation function, perform the rotation of the binary string by shifting the characters to the left and appending the shifted out characters to the end.\n4. After each rotation, convert the binary string back to an integer value and check if it is odd.\n5. Keep track of the count of odd numbers and return the final count.\n\nThis design provides a clear overview of the steps involved in implementing the odd_Equivalent function without getting into specific implementation details.
