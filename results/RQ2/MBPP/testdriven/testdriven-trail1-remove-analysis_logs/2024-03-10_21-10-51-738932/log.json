    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\nThe function amicable_numbers_sum(limit) should take a single parameter 'limit', which represents the upper limit for finding amicable numbers. The function should return the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to the specified limit.\n\nThe algorithm for finding amicable numbers involves iterating through all numbers from 1 to the limit, and for each number, calculating the sum of its proper divisors. Once the sum is calculated, the function should then check if the sum is equal to another number's value and vice versa. If both numbers meet this condition, they are considered amicable numbers and their sum should be added to the total sum.\n\nThe function should handle the case when the limit is less than 1, and should return 0 in this scenario.\n\nThe function should also include appropriate error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or negative numbers.\n\nOverall, the design should focus on providing a clear and efficient algorithm for finding and summing amicable numbers, without delving into specific implementation details such as variable names or specific mathematical calculations.",
