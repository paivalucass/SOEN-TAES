    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n- The find_lucas function should take an integer n as input.\n- It should return the n'th Lucas number.\n- Use the following formula to calculate the Lucas number:\n  - L(n) = F(n-1) + F(n+1) where F(n) is the n'th Fibonacci number.\n- The function should handle the base cases for n=0 and n=1 where the Lucas numbers are 2 and 1 respectively.\n- The developer should handle the input validation for negative integers.\n\nThis design provides a high-level overview of the approach to be taken in implementing the find_lucas function. It focuses on the logic and algorithm to be used, rather than specific code implementation details.",
