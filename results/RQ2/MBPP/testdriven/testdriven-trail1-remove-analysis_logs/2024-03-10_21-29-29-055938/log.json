    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\n- The check_expression function should take an expression as input and return a boolean value indicating whether the expression is balanced or not.\n- Use a stack data structure to track opening and closing symbols in the expression.\n- Iterate through each character in the expression and perform the following steps:\n  - If the character is an opening symbol ({, [, or ( ), push it onto the stack.\n  - If the character is a closing symbol (}, ], or ), pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the corresponding opening symbol. If it does not match or if the stack is empty, return False.\n- After iterating through all characters, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return True to indicate that the expression is balanced; otherwise, return False.\n\nThis design provides a high-level overview of the approach to be taken in implementing the check_expression function. It guides the developer in using a stack to track opening and closing symbols and in iterating through the expression to determine if it is balanced.",
