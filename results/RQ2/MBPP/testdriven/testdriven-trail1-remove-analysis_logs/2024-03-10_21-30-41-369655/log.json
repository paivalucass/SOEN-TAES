The regular expression pattern would be \"a.*b\" to match a string that has an 'a' followed by anything, ending in 'b'. \n\nThe developer should use the re module in Python to create a regular expression object and use the search function to check if the input string matches the pattern. The function should return True if there is a match, and False otherwise.\n\nIt is important to ensure that the function is properly documented to explain its purpose and usage.
