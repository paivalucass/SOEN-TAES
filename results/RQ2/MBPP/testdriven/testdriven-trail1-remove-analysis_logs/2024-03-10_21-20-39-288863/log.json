    "DesignDraft": "Design:\nCreate a function called sumofFactors that takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of even factors of the input number.\n\nThe function should iterate through all numbers from 1 to n and check if each number is a factor of n. If the number is a factor and it is even, add it to a running total. Once all numbers have been checked, return the total sum of even factors.\n\nThis design provides a high-level approach to solving the requirement and guides the developer in writing the code without getting into specific implementation details.",
    "DesignMeetings": "{\n  \"Developer\": \"As a developer, I would suggest adding error handling to the function to handle the case where the input integer is 0 or negative. Additionally, I would recommend optimizing the function to only iterate through numbers up to the square root of n, as factors come in pairs and iterating beyond the square root is unnecessary.\",\n  \"Tester\": \"As a tester, I would suggest creating test cases to cover scenarios such as inputting a prime number, a negative number, and 0 to ensure the function handles these cases correctly. I would also recommend testing the function with large input numbers to check for performance and efficiency.\"\n}",

Optimization: The function should be optimized to only iterate through numbers up to the square root of n, as factors come in pairs and iterating beyond the square root is unnecessary. This will improve the efficiency of the function.\n\n3. Test Cases: Test cases should be created to cover scenarios such as inputting a prime number, a negative number, and 0 to ensure the function handles these cases correctly.
