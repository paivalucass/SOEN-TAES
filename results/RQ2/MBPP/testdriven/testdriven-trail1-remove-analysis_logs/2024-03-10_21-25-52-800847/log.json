    "DesignDraft": "Design:\nThe Split function should take a list of numbers as input and return a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list. The function should iterate through the input list and use a conditional statement to check if each number is even. If the number is even, it should be added to the new list. The function should then return the new list containing the even numbers.\n\nThis design guides the developer to focus on creating a function that iterates through the input list, checks for even numbers, and creates a new list containing only the even numbers. It does not provide specific implementation details, as those can vary based on the developer's coding style and language preferences.\n\nBy following this high-level design, the developer can create a Split function that meets the requirements and passes the provided assertion test.",
