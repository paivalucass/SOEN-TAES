    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\nThe design for the function check_smaller should be focused on providing guidance to the developer in writing the code. The function should take two tuples as input and compare each element of the second tuple with its corresponding element in the first tuple to check if the second tuple element is smaller than the first tuple element.\n\nPseudocode:\n1. Define a function named check_smaller that takes two input parameters test_tup1 and test_tup2.\n2. Initialize a variable result to True.\n3. Iterate over the elements of test_tup1 and test_tup2 simultaneously using a for loop.\n4. Inside the loop, compare each element of test_tup2 with its corresponding element in test_tup1. If any element in test_tup2 is greater than or equal to its corresponding element in test_tup1, set result to False and break out of the loop.\n5. After the loop, return the value of result.\n\nThis high-level design provides guidance to the developer on how to structure the function, iterate over the tuples, and perform the comparison without delving into specific implementation details.",
