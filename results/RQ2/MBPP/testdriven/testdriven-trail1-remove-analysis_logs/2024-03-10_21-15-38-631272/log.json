    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\nThe validation function should take in an integer as a parameter and return a boolean value indicating whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.\n\nTo accomplish this, the function should first convert the integer into a string to easily iterate through each digit. Then, it should create a dictionary to store the frequency of each digit. After iterating through the string, the function should compare the frequency of each digit with the digit itself. If at any point the frequency is greater than the digit, the function should return False. Otherwise, it should return True.\n\nThis high-level design provides a clear outline for the logic and approach the developer should take when implementing the validation function in Python.",
