Initialize two boolean variables, increasing and decreasing, to True.\n2. Iterate through the array A to check if it is increasing or decreasing.\n3. If the array is increasing, set the increasing variable to True and decreasing variable to False.\n4. If the array is decreasing, set the decreasing variable to True and increasing variable to False.\n5. If both increasing and decreasing variables are True at any point, the array is not monotonic and return False.\n6. If the loop completes without both variables being True, the array is monotonic and return True.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef is_Monotonic(A):\n    increasing = True\n    decreasing = True\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(A)):\n        if A[i] > A[i-1]:\n            decreasing = False\n        elif A[i] < A[i-1]:\n            increasing = False\n        \n        if not increasing and not decreasing:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\nassert is_Monotonic([6, 5, 4, 4]) == True\n```\n\nNote: The above design provides a high-level approach to the problem and guides the developer on how to structure the code.
