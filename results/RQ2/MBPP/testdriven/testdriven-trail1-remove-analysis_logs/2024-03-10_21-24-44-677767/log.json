    "DesignDraft": "Design:\nThe bell_Number function should take an integer n as input and return the nth bell number. The bell number for a given n is defined as the number of ways a set of n elements can be partitioned into non-empty subsets. \n\nThe implementation of the bell_Number function should follow the following high-level steps:\n1. Define a function bell_Number that takes an integer n as input.\n2. If n is less than or equal to 1, return 1 as the bell number.\n3. Create a 2D array bell[n+1][n+1] and initialize it with 0.\n4. Set bell[0][0] = 1.\n5. Use nested loops to calculate the bell numbers using the following formula:\n   bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]\n6. Return the value of bell[n][0] as the nth bell number.\n\nThis design provides a high-level overview of the steps and logic required to implement the bell_Number function in Python, allowing the developer to understand the key concepts and algorithm without getting into specific implementation details.",

This addresses the suggestion from the tester to ensure comprehensive testing of the function.\n\nThe implementation of the bell_Number function will still take an integer n as input and return the nth bell number. However, the internal logic and algorithm for calculating the bell numbers will be optimized using dynamic programming, as suggested by the developer.
