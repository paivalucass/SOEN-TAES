The actual output does not match the expected output. The function did not successfully remove the parenthesis as expected.\n\nRecommendation: The code for the remove_parenthesis function needs to be reviewed and updated to ensure it functions as intended.\n\nNote: Additional test cases may be needed to thoroughly test the remove_parenthesis function.\n\nTest Status: FAIL",
