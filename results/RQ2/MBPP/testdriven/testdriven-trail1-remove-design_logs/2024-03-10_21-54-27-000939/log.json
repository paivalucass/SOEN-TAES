    "AnalyzeDraft": "{\n  \"requirement\": \"The requirement is to write a Python function called is_not_prime(n) that can identify non-prime numbers. The function should return True if the given number is not prime, and False if the number is prime. Additionally, the function should assert that is_not_prime(2) returns False.\",\n  \"response\": \"A high-level response to this requirement would be to define a Python function called is_not_prime(n) that takes a number as input and uses a prime number checking algorithm to determine if the number is not prime. The function should then return True if the number is not prime and False if the number is prime. Additionally, the function should include an assertion to verify that is_not_prime(2) returns False.\"\n}",
    "AnalyzeMeetings": "{\n  \"Architect\": \"Based on the requirement, the function should first check if the input number is 2, and return False if it is. Then, it should iterate through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number to check for divisibility. If it finds any divisor, it should return True to indicate that the number is not prime. This approach will make the function more efficient in identifying non-prime numbers.\",\n  \"Tester\": \"When testing the function, make sure to include test cases for prime and non-prime numbers. Test the function with small numbers, large numbers, and edge cases like 0 and 1. Also, verify that the assertion for is_not_prime(2) returns False as specified in the requirement.\"\n}"
