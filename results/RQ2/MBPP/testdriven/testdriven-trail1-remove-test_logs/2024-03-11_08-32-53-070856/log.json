Output: boolean value (true or false)\n4. Algorithm:\n   - Convert the input tuple into a set to remove duplicates.\n   - Compare the length of the original tuple with the length of the set.\n   - If the lengths are equal, return True (no duplicates), otherwise return False (contains duplicates).\n5. Error handling:\n   - Check if the input is a tuple, if not, raise an error.\n6. Testing:\n   - Test with various sizes of tuples, including empty tuples and tuples with different data types.\n   - Test with tuples containing both duplicate and non-duplicate elements to ensure accurate detection of duplicates.\n7. Documentation:\n   - Include a docstring explaining the purpose of the function and an example usage with an assertion.\n\nExample design implementation:\n\n```python\ndef check_distinct(test_tup):\n    '''Function to check if given tuple contains no duplicates.'''\n    if not isinstance(test_tup, tuple):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input should be a tuple\")\n    \n    unique_set = set(test_tup)\n    if len(test_tup) == len(unique_set):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Example usage\nassert check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)) == False\n```\n\nThis high-level design provides guidance to the developer on how to approach writing the code for the function, focusing on the algorithm, error handling, testing, and documentation aspects.",
