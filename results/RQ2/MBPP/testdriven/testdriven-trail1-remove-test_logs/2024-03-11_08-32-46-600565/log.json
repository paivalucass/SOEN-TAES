It takes three input lists, l1, l2, and l3, which contain student IDs, student names, and their respective scores. The function is expected to return a nested dictionary where each student ID is the key, and the value is a dictionary containing the student name and score.\n\nIt should also include error handling for invalid input and handle the case when the input lists have different lengths. The design includes an assertion to test the function with sample input and expected output. This will guide the developer in writing the code for the function.",
