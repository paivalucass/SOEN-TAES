Additionally, the function should include input validation to check if the two input lists are of the same length before performing element-wise division, and an assertion to validate that the function works correctly with a specific input.\n\nThe high-level design for the div_list function is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef div_list(nums1, nums2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Function to divide two lists element wise.\n    \n    Args:\n    nums1 (list): First input list\n    nums2 (list): Second input list\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: New list with the result of the division\n    \n    Raises:\n    ValueError: If the input lists are not of the same length\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(nums1) != len(nums2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input lists must be of the same length\")\n    \n    result = [x / y for x, y in zip(nums1, nums2)]\n    \n    return result\n\nassert div_list([4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3]) == [4.0, 2.5, 2.0]\n```\n\nThis design provides clear guidance for the developer to implement the div_list function with input validation and assertion as per the revised requirement.

The assertion at the end validates the function's correctness with a specific input.",
