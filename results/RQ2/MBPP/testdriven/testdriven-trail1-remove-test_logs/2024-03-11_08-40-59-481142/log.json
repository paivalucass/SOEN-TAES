This function will take a string s as input and iterate through the input string to compare each character to the first character. If any character is found to be different, the function should return False. Otherwise, it should return True.\n\nHigh-level design:\n```python\ndef all_Characters_Same(s):\n    # Iterate through the input string\n    for char in s[1:]:\n        # Compare each character to the first character\n        if char != s[0]:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nDeveloper guidance:\n1. Create a Python function named all_Characters_Same with a parameter s.\n2. Iterate through the input string using a for loop.\n3. Compare each character to the first character using an if statement.\n4. If any character is found to be different, return False. Otherwise, return True.\n\nThis high-level design guides the developer to implement the logic described in the requirement and provides a clear structure for writing the code.",
