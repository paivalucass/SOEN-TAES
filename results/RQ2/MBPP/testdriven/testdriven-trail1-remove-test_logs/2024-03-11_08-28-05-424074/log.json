The developer will need to fill in the logic to check for the sum of non-zero powers of 2 within the function.\n\nThe design also includes an assertion to check if the function returns the expected result for a specific test case (i.e., `is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(10)` should return `True`). This is to guide the developer in writing test cases to validate the function's behavior.\n\nAdditionally, the design does not include specific error handling or input validation details, as these can be implemented as separate smaller, reusable functions as suggested by the architect in the context.",
