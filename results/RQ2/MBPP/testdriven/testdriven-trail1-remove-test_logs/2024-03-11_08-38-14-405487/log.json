    "DesignDraft": "High-level Design:\n\nThe first step in designing the `first_repeated_char` function is to consider the efficiency and scalability of the solution. The function should be able to handle different scenarios and edge cases such as empty string or single character input. To optimize the function, it may be beneficial to use data structures like sets or dictionaries.\n\nHere is a high-level design for the `first_repeated_char` function:\n\n```python\ndef first_repeated_char(str1):\n    # Create a set to store the characters we have seen so far\n    seen_chars = set()\n\n    # Iterate through the string and check if each character has been seen before\n    for char in str1:\n        if char in seen_chars:\n            return char\n        else:\n            seen_chars.add(char)\n\n    # If no repeated character is found, return 'None'\n    return None\n\n# Test the function with the provided assertion test case\nassert first_repeated_char(\"abcabc\") == \"a\"\n```\n\nThis design provides a high-level overview of the `first_repeated_char` function and guides the developer in writing code to implement the solution. The use of a set to store seen characters helps optimize the function for efficiency and scalability. Additionally, the function handles the edge cases mentioned in the requirement, such as empty string or single character input.",

One suggestion would be to add some error handling for the edge cases mentioned in the context, such as empty string or single character input. This can help make the function more robust.\",\n  \"Tester\": \"The high-level design seems to cover the basic functionality and edge cases. As a tester, I would suggest adding more test cases to cover a wider range of scenarios, such as strings with no repeated characters, strings with special characters, and very long strings to test for efficiency.\"\n}",
