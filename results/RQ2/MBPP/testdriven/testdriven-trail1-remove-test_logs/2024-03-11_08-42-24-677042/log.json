This can be achieved by breaking down the function into smaller, more modular functions that handle specific tasks related to finding the nth polite number.\n\nTo improve the performance of the function for larger input values, caching should be considered. This involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.\n\nIn terms of testing, comprehensive test cases should be created to cover a wide range of input values, including edge cases and invalid inputs. Additionally, mocking of external dependencies, such as network requests, should be used to ensure that the test cases are isolated and reliable.\n\nThe overall design should focus on modularity, performance optimization through caching, and comprehensive testing with mocking of external dependencies.
