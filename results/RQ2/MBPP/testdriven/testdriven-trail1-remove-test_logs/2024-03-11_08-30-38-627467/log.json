    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\n- Function Name: lateralsurface_cube\n- Input: l (side length of the cube)\n- Output: Lateral surface area of the cube\n\nHigh-level Description:\n1. The function lateralsurface_cube takes a parameter l representing the side length of a cube and returns the lateral surface area of the cube.\n2. The function should consider any constraints or limitations for the input parameter, such as ensuring l is a positive number.\n3. The lateral surface area calculation formula for a cube is 4 * l^2.\n\nGuidance for Developer:\n- Write a function lateralsurface_cube that takes a parameter l and returns the lateral surface area of the cube.\n- Include a check to ensure that the input parameter l is a positive number.\n- Use the formula 4 * l^2 to calculate the lateral surface area.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef lateralsurface_cube(l):\n    return 4 * (l ** 2)\n\n# Test case\nassert lateralsurface_cube(5) == 100\n```",
