It returns True if the condition is met, otherwise it returns False. The assertion is included to validate the behavior of the function with a specific test case (is_Diff(12345) should return False).\n\nThis design provides a clear and concise guideline for the developer to implement the function while also explaining the purpose and behavior of the function.",
