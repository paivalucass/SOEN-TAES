It includes the algorithm to convert degrees to radians and focuses on guiding the developer in writing code to achieve the desired functionality. The design does not include detailed implementation specifics, but rather provides a clear guidance for the developer to follow.",
    "DesignMeetings": "{\n  \"Developer\": \"The design is clear and provides a good overview of the function. One suggestion would be to include some error handling, such as checking if the input is within the valid range of degrees (0 to 360) before performing the conversion.\",\n  \"Tester\": \"The design looks good and straightforward. One suggestion for testing would be to include test cases for boundary values, such as 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 360 degrees, to ensure the function handles these cases correctly.\"\n}",

If the input is outside this range, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate error message. This enhancement addresses the suggestion from the developer.\n\nI have also added a try-except block to catch the `ValueError` and handle it by printing the error message. This improvement aligns with the suggestion from the tester to include test cases for boundary values and to ensure the function handles these cases correctly.\n\nOverall, the new design incorporates the suggestions provided by the developer and tester, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the `radian_degree` function.",
