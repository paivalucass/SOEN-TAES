This suggests that the code has failed to import the 'unittest' module successfully.\n\nConclusion:\nCode Test Failed\n\nInput and Expected Output Example:\nInput:\nimport unittest\nclass Test(unittest.TestCase):\n   # test cases\n   ...\n\nExpected Output:\nNo NameError indicating 'unittest' is not defined.\n\nNote: The code has failed to import the 'unittest' module, leading to a NameError. Further investigation and correction are required to resolve this issue.\n\nEnd of Test Report.",
