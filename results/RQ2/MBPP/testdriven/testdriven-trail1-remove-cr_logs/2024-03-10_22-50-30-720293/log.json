This indicates a failure in the code.\n\nConclusion:\nCode Test Failed\n\nInput Example:\nimport unittest\n\nExpected Output Example:\nNo errors\n\nRecommendation:\nThe code needs to be modified to ensure the 'unittest' module is properly defined to resolve the NameError.\n\nTest Report Completed.",
