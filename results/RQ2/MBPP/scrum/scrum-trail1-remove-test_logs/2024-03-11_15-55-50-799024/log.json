One suggested approach is to use a deque data structure for an efficient solution. The deque data structure allows for efficient right rotation operation in O(n) time complexity.\n\nThe rotate_right function should take two parameters: the list to be rotated and the number of items to rotate to the right. The function should return the rotated list.\n\nHere is an example of the function signature:\n```python\ndef rotate_right(lst, m):\n    # implementation goes here\n```\n\nDevelopers should consider using the deque data structure and the efficient right rotation operation for implementing the rotate_right function. This approach will ensure that the function is both efficient and performs the right rotation operation in O(n) time complexity.\n\nTesting of the rotate_right function is also crucial. It should be thoroughly tested, especially for edge cases and potential errors. A testing strategy should be outlined in the document, including specific test cases and expected results.\n\nReferences:\n- Python Program to Right Rotate a List (source: geeksforgeeks.org)",
