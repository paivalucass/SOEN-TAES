Function Definition:\n   - Define a function \"colon_tuplex\" that takes three parameters: the input tuple \"tuplex\", the index \"m\" at which the new element should be added, and the new element \"n\" to be inserted at index \"m\".\n   - The function should return the modified tuple with the new element added at the specified index.\n\n3. Testing:\n   - Create test cases to validate the functionality of the \"colon_tuplex\" function, including positive and negative test scenarios to ensure that the feature works as expected and handles errors effectively.\n\nThis high-level design should guide the developer in writing code to implement the \"colon_tuplex\" function, focusing on the overall structure and functionality rather than specific implementation details.",
