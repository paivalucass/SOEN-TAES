Then, for each increasing subsequence, it should calculate the product of all the numbers in that subsequence and keep track of the maximum product found so far.\n\nTo improve modularity and code organization, the max_product function should be broken down into smaller, reusable functions. For example, separate functions can be created to identify increasing subsequences and to calculate the product of a subsequence.\n\nCaching can be implemented to improve performance for large input arrays. The function can store the maximum product for each subsequence in a cache, so that if the same subsequence is encountered again, the function can retrieve the maximum product from the cache instead of recalculating it.\n\nComprehensive test cases should be created to cover various scenarios, such as empty arrays, arrays with negative numbers, and arrays with duplicate numbers. Additionally, edge cases should be tested to ensure that the function handles all possible input cases accurately.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    '''\n    Write a function to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of that array.\n    assert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000\n    '''\n```",
