The function should be designed to handle nested lists and should provide the total sum of all elements within the list.\n\nHigh-level design:\n1. Define the recursive_list_sum function that takes a data_list as input.\n2. Check if the input data_list is empty, if so, return 0 as the sum.\n3. Iterate through each element in the data_list.\n4. If the element is a list, recursively call the recursive_list_sum function on the nested list and add the result to the total sum.\n5. If the element is not a list, add it directly to the total sum.\n6. Return the total sum.\n\nThis high-level design provides a clear understanding of the functionality required and guides the developer in writing the code to implement the recursive_list_sum function.
