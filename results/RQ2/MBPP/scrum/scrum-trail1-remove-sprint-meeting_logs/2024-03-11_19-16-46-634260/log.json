If K is greater than the length of the tuple, return the original tuple.\\n- Note: \\n    - The original list is not modified.\\n\\nHigh-Level Design:\\n```python\\ndef trim_tuple(tupleList, K):\\n    if not tupleList:\\n        return []\\n    trimmed_list = []\\n    for tup in tupleList:\\n        if K >= len(tup):\\n            trimmed_list.append(tup)\\n        else:\\n            trimmed_tup = tup[K:]\\n            trimmed_list.append(trimmed_tup)\\n    return trimmed_list\\n\\n# Example Usage:\\nassert trim_tuple([(5, 3, 2, 1, 4), (3, 4, 9, 2, 1), (9, 1, 2, 3, 5), (4, 8, 2, 1, 7)], 2) == [(2, 1, 4), (9, 2, 1), (2, 3, 5), (2, 1, 7)]\\nassert trim_tuple([], 2) == []\\nassert trim_tuple([(5, 3, 2, 1, 4), (3, 4, 9, 2, 1), (9, 1, 2, 3, 5), (4, 8, 2, 1, 7)], 6) == [(5, 3, 2, 1, 4), (3, 4, 9, 2, 1), (9, 1, 2, 3, 5), (4, 8, 2, 1, 7)]\\n```\", \"Question\": \"def trim_tuple(test_list, K):\\n'''Write a function to trim each tuple by k in the given tuple list.\\nassert trim_tuple([(5, 3, 2, 1, 4), (3, 4, 9, 2, 1),(9, 1, 2, 3, 5), (4, 8, 2, 1, 7)], 2) == '[(2,), (9,), (2,), (2,)]''''\\n\"}",
