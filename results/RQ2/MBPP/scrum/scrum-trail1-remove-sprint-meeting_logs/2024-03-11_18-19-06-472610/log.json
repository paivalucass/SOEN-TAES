For the 'Valid kth Element' test case, we can add a boundary test with k=1 to make sure that the first element is returned. For the 'k is Out of Range' test case, we should also test for the case when k is negative to handle that scenario. For the 'kth Element Not Found' test case, we can add a test with k=6 to ensure that the correct error message is returned.\\\"\\n}\\n # Draft Test cases:\\n{\\n  \\\"Test Cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Empty Array\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=[], k=1\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"Error: Input array should not be empty\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Valid kth Element\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=[12,3,5,7,19], k=2\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"3\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"k is Out of Range\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=[12,3,5,7,19], k=6\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"Error: k is out of range\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"kth Element Not Found\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=[12,3,5,7,19], k=0\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"Error: kth element not found in the array\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction.
