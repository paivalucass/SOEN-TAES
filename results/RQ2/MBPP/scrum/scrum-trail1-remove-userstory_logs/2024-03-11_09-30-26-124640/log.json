The function should return a boolean value indicating whether the given tuple contains the value K or not.\n\nHigh-Level Design:\n1. Define a function called check_K that takes two parameters test_tup (tuple) and K (integer).\n2. Inside the function, iterate through the elements of the tuple test_tup.\n3. For each element, compare it with the value of K.\n4. If a match is found, return True indicating that K is present in the tuple.\n5. If no match is found after iterating through all elements, return False indicating that K is not present in the tuple.\n\nGuidance for the Developer:\n- Use a for loop to iterate through the elements of the tuple.\n- Use an if condition to compare each element with the value of K.\n- Return True as soon as a match is found.\n- If no match is found after iterating through all elements, return False.\n\nNote: The design focuses on the high-level logic and approach for implementing the check_K function, rather than specific implementation details.",
