The function will take a list of integers as input and return the absolute difference between the first even and first odd number.\n\nHigh-level design considerations:\n1. Input and Output Requirements:\n   - Input: A list of integers\n   - Output: Absolute difference between the first even and first odd number\n\n2. Algorithm:\n   - Iterate through the list to identify the first even and first odd number\n   - Calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers\n   - Return the absolute difference as the output\n\n3. Performance and Scalability:\n   - The algorithm should have a time complexity of O(n) to efficiently iterate through the list and identify the first even and odd numbers.\n   - Consider potential optimizations for large input lists to ensure scalability.\n\n4. Error Handling:\n   - Validate the input list to ensure it contains at least one even and one odd number. If not, return an appropriate error or default value.\n\n5. Testing:\n   - Design comprehensive test cases to cover different scenarios, including lists with multiple even and odd numbers, empty lists, and edge cases.\n\n6. Team Collaboration:\n   - Lead the team in discussing and evaluating different algorithm options to determine the most efficient and optimal solution.\n\nPseudocode:\n```\nfunction diff_even_odd(list1):\n    even_found = False\n    odd_found = False\n    diff = 0\n    \n    for num in list1:\n        if num % 2 == 0 and not even_found:\n            even = num\n            even_found = True\n        elif num % 2 != 0 and not odd_found:\n            odd = num\n            odd_found = True\n        \n        if even_found and odd_found:\n            diff = abs(even - odd)\n            break\n    \n    return diff\n```\n\nBy following this design, the developer will be guided to implement the diff_even_odd function with a clear and efficient algorithm that meets the functional and non-functional requirements.",
