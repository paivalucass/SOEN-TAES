    "DesignDraft0": "Design:\n\nThe requirement is to create a Python function to determine whether a number is divisible by 11. To achieve this, we can break down the problem into smaller modules and create a design that focuses on scalability and maintainability.\n\nWe can start by creating a function called is_Diff that takes a parameter n, which represents the number to be checked for divisibility by 11.\n\nThe high-level design for the function is as follows:\n\n1. Input Validation: The function should first validate the input to ensure it is a valid number.\n\n2. Divisibility Check: The function should then check if the input number is divisible by 11.\n\n3. Return: The function should return True if the number is divisible by 11, otherwise it should return False.\n\nThis design provides a clear outline for the developer to follow and helps in ensuring that the code is structured for scalability and maintainability. It guides the developer in writing code by focusing on the key components of the function without providing implementation details.",
