The error message \"Input must be a list of numbers\" suggests that the input provided to the multiply_num function is not a list of numbers as expected. This resulted in a TypeError.\n\nConclusion:\nCode Test Failed\n\nInput and Expected Output Example:\nInput: (8, 2, 3, -1, 7)\nExpected Output: -67.2\n\nCode:\nimport math\n\ndef multiply_num(numbers):\n    if not isinstance(numbers, list) or not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in numbers):\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list of numbers\")\n\n    product = 1\n    for num in numbers:\n        product *= num\n\n    result = product / len(numbers)\n    return result\n\nRecommendation:\nThe code needs to be modified to handle the input validation and exception handling to prevent the TypeError. Additionally, it is important to verify that the expected output matches the actual output to ensure accurate test results.\n\nEnd of Test Report.# suggestions:\n{\"product-owner\": [\"We need to prioritize fixing the input validation and exception handling in the code to prevent the TypeError and ensure accurate test results.\"], \"architect\": [\"We should prioritize updating the code to include input validation and exception handling to prevent the TypeError and ensure accurate test results.
