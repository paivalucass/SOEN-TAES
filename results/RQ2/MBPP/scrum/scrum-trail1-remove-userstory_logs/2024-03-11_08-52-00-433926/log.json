    "DesignDraft0": "Design:\n\nThe design for the given requirement would involve creating a function that takes in two arrays - one representing colors and the other representing patterns. The function would then check whether the sequence of colors follows the sequence given in the patterns array. Here is a high-level outline of the design:\n\n1. Input Parameters:\n   - colors: An array representing the sequence of colors.\n   - patterns: An array representing the sequence of patterns.\n\n2. Output:\n   - Boolean value indicating whether the sequence of colors follows the sequence given in the patterns array.\n\n3. Algorithm:\n   - Iterate through the colors array and patterns array simultaneously.\n   - Check if the current color corresponds to the current pattern.\n   - If the correspondence breaks at any point, return False.\n   - If the entire sequence matches, return True.\n\n4. Example Usage:\n   - Call the function with input arrays and assert the expected output.\n\nThis design provides a high-level overview of the function's purpose and algorithm, guiding the developer in writing the code without diving into specific implementation details. It sets the foundation for implementing the function to check whether the sequence follows the given patterns.",
