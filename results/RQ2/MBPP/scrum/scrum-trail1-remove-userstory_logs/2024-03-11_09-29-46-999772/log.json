    "DesignDraft0": "Design:\nFor the requirement to write a Python function to count the number of equal numbers from three given integers, we should follow a modular approach to create a flexible and scalable solution.\n\nOne possible high-level design for this function could involve creating a modular function that takes three integers as input and compares them to determine the number of equal numbers. The function should return the count of equal numbers.\n\nFor example:\n```python\ndef count_equal_numbers(x, y, z):\n    count = 0\n    if x == y and y == z:\n        count = 3\n    elif x == y or y == z or x == z:\n        count = 2\n    return count\n```\n\nThis design provides a high-level outline for the function, focusing on the logic and structure rather than specific implementation details.
