    "DesignDraft0": "Design:\n\nThe expression checking function should take a string input representing an expression and return a boolean value indicating whether the expression is balanced or not.\n\nHigh-level design guidelines:\n1. The function should utilize a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets as we iterate through the expression.\n2. We should iterate through the input expression, and for each character:\n    a. If it is an opening bracket ({, [, or (, we push it onto the stack.\n    b. If it is a closing bracket (}, ], or ), we check if the stack is empty. If it is, return False since there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket. If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack and compare it with the current closing bracket. If they don't match, return False.\n3. After iterating through the entire expression, if the stack is empty, return True indicating that the expression is balanced. If the stack is not empty, return False.\n\nThis high-level design provides clear guidance for the developer to implement the expression checking function.
