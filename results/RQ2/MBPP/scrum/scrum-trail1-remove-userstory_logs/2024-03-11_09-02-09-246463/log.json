This can be achieved by breaking down the functionality into smaller, independent modules that can be easily maintained and extended in the future.\n\nIn terms of architecture, the developer should consider using a modular approach, such as defining separate functions for generating odd natural numbers, calculating their squares, and then summing them up. This will allow for better code organization and improved reusability.\n\nIn addition, the technology stack should be chosen based on the scalability and performance requirements of the solution.
