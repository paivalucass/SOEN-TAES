The function correctly identifies the parity of the input number and returns the expected output for both even and odd numbers, including zero and negative numbers. Additionally, it handles the largest and smallest numbers as well as invalid input by raising the appropriate errors. Overall, the function has passed the test cases and meets the requirements and expected behavior.\n\nCode Test Passed"
