    "TestReport3": "Test Report:\n\nContext:\nThe test script's output indicates an error in the code related to the 'set_middle_bits' function.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe error is caused by a NameError, indicating that the 'set_middle_bits' function is not defined. The code appears to contain a different function 'toggle_middle_bits' instead. It seems that there may be a naming discrepancy in the test script.\n\nConclusion:\nAs per the analysis, it is evident that the code has failed due to a naming error. The 'set_middle_bits' function is not defined, and the test script is attempting to use it, resulting in a failure. Therefore, the code test has failed.\n\nInput and Expected Output Example:\nThe input example used in the test script: self.assertEqual(set_middle_bits(9), 15)\nExpected output: set_middle_bits(9) should return 15.\n\nOverall Conclusion:\nCode Test Failed."
