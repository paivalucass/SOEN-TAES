Data Structure:\n   - The input nested mixed tuple will be represented as a collection of tuples and elements.\n   - The nested structure will be handled using recursion to traverse through the tuple elements.\n\n2. Functionality:\n   - The function 'even_ele' will take two parameters: 'test_tuple' (the input nested mixed tuple) and 'even_fnc' (the function to check if an element is even).\n   - The 'even_fnc' will be used to determine if an element is even or uneven.\n   - The 'even_ele' function will iterate through the nested tuple and remove the uneven elements based on the result of the 'even_fnc' function.\n\n3. Output:\n   - The function will return a new nested mixed tuple with the uneven elements removed.\n\nNote: The design focuses on guiding the developer in writing the code for the given requirement, rather than providing specific implementation details.",
