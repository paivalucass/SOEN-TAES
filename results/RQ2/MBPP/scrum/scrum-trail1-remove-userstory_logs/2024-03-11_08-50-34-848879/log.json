To achieve this, we can use a set data structure for efficiency.\n\nHere is a high-level design for the function:\n\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(input_string, dirty_characters):\n    # Convert dirty_characters string to a set for efficient lookups\n    dirty_set = set(dirty_characters)\n    \n    # Use list comprehension to filter out characters not present in dirty_set\n    result = ''.join([char for char in input_string if char not in dirty_set])\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis design allows the developer to understand the overall approach and use of set data structure to efficiently filter out characters from the input string based on the characters present in the dirty_characters string.",
