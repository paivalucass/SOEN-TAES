    "DesignDraft0": "In order to design the software architecture for the requirement of finding the first repeated character in a given string, we will analyze different approaches and design an algorithm for achieving this functionality.\n\nOne high-level approach for this requirement could involve utilizing a data structure like a hash map or dictionary to store the characters of the string as keys and their occurrences as values. Then, we can iterate through the string and check if the character already exists in the hash map. If it does, we can return that character as the first repeated character. If no repeated character is found, we can return None or an appropriate indicator.\n\nThis approach focuses on efficient storage and retrieval of character occurrences, and it guides the developer towards implementing a solution using a suitable data structure and iteration method. It does not provide specific implementation details, but rather outlines the overall strategy for approaching the problem.",
