The input will be a number, and the output will be the first digit of that number.\n\nNext, we need to consider how the function will handle different types of input, such as positive and negative numbers, and numbers with multiple digits.\n\nThe function should first check if the input number is positive or negative. If the number is negative, the function should return the first digit as a negative number. If the number is positive, the function should return the first digit as a positive number.\n\nTo find the first digit of a positive number, the function can use the math.floor() function to round down the number to the nearest integer, and then use integer division to extract the first digit.\n\nFor example, if the input number is 123, the function should return 1 as the first digit.\n\nOverall, the function should be designed to handle different types of input and accurately return the first digit of the given number.
