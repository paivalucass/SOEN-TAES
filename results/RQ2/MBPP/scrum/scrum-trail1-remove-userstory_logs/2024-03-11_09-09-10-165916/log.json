    "DesignDraft0": "Design:\n\nThe design for the rearrange_bigger function should focus on efficiently rearranging the digits of the given number to create the next bigger number. This design should take into consideration potential trade-offs and design considerations related to algorithmic approach and efficiency.\n\nThe function should take a single parameter, n, representing the input number.\n\nThe function should start by converting the input number into a list of digits to enable manipulation.\n\nNext, the function should iterate through the list of digits to find the first occurrence of a digit that is smaller than its right neighbor. This will be the pivot digit.\n\nOnce the pivot digit is identified, the function should then search for the smallest digit to the right of the pivot digit that is larger than the pivot digit. This digit will be swapped with the pivot digit.\n\nAfter the swap, the function should sort all the digits to the right of the pivot index in ascending order, ensuring that the resulting number is the next bigger number.\n\nFinally, the function should convert the list of digits back to a single integer and return the result.\n\nThis high-level design provides a clear strategy for creating the next bigger number by rearranging the digits of the given number. It guides the developer in writing code that efficiently implements the required functionality, while also considering potential trade-offs and design considerations related to algorithmic approach and efficiency.",
