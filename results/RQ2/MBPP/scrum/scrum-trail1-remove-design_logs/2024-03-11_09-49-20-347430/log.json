Let's consider the scalability and maintainability of the solution. I think the first step is to analyze the requirements and create a high-level design. In order to develop a product, it is important that we consider the performance and security aspects of the system. Firstly, we should create a modular and extensible architecture. I will start by creating an architectural blueprint for the solution.\n-----\n\n[ProductOwner]says: [ProductOwner] To create a product, we should prioritize understanding the user requirements and aligning our development efforts with their needs. Let's start by gathering user feedback and conducting market research.\n-----\n\n[Architect]says: As an Architect, I agree that defining the architecture and design of the system should be our first step, considering scalability and maintainability. I will start by creating a high-level design and analyzing the requirements.\n-----\n"
