It is important to define the expected behavior for edge cases and clearly specify any assumptions made in the function design. The assertion test provided should cover a wide range of test cases, including empty lists, lists with the same values, and lists with different values. The test cases should also include boundary and negative test scenarios to ensure the robustness of the count_same_pair function.\",\n  \"test_cases\": [\n    {\n      \"Test Title\": \"Empty Lists\",\n      \"Input Data\": \"nums1=[], nums2=[]\",\n      \"Expected Output\": \"0\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Test Title\": \"Lists with the Same Values\",\n      \"Input Data\": \"nums1=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], nums2=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\",\n      \"Expected Output\": \"5\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Test Title\": \"Lists with Duplicate Values\",\n      \"Input Data\": \"nums1=[1, 2, 2, 3, 4], nums2=[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]\",\n      \"Expected Output\": \"5\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Test Title\": \"Lists with Negative Numbers\",\n      \"Input Data\": \"nums1=[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5], nums2=[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]\",\n      \"Expected Output\": \"5\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Test Title\": \"Lists with Large Numbers\",\n      \"Input Data\": \"nums1=[1000000, 2000000, 3000000, 4000000, 5000000], nums2=[1000000, 2000000, 3000000, 4000000, 5000000]\",\n      \"Expected Output\": \"5\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Test Title\": \"Boundary Test Scenario\",\n      \"Input Data\": \"nums1=[10, 20, 30, 40, 50], nums2=[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\",\n      \"Expected Output\": \"5\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Test Title\": \"Negative Test Scenario\",\n      \"Input Data\": \"nums1=[1, 2, 3], nums2=[4, 5, 6]\",\n      \"Expected Output\": \"0\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
