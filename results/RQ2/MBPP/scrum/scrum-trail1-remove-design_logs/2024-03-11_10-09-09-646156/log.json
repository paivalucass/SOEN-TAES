Let's discuss with the team on how to address this issue.\\n-----\\n\\n[Architect]says: As an Architect, to address the test failure, I suggest reviewing the code for circle_circumference and ensuring that the expected and actual outputs are aligned. Additionally, implementing proper testing practices and continuous integration can help prevent similar issues in the future.\\n-----\\n\\n[Architect]says: As an Architect, to address the test failure, I suggest reviewing the code for circle_circumference and ensuring that the expected and actual outputs are aligned.
