The 'list.remove(x): x not in list' error indicates that the remove function is trying to remove an element that does not exist in the list. This has caused the test to fail.\n\nRecommendation:\nThe 'adjac' function needs to be reviewed and debugged to ensure that the remove function operates on existing elements in the list. Once the issue is resolved, the test should be rerun to verify the code's functionality.\n\nCode Test Failed"
