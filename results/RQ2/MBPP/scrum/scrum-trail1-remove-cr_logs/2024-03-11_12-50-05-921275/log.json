Additionally, I will provide a detailed algorithm or method for performing the calculation based on the mathematical formula for calculating the perimeter of a regular pentagon. As a tester, I will also create test cases for various scenarios such as different input values for the length of the sides of the pentagon, including edge cases. I will also have clear expectations for the expected output of the calculation and compare the actual output with the expected results in the test cases.\\\"\\n \\t\\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t\\n# Tasks:\\n['Write test cases for perimeter_pentagon function', 'Ensure correct perimeter calculation for different input values']\\n# Design:\\nBased on the suggestions provided, here is the new design for the perimeter_pentagon function:\\n\\nDesign:\\nThe function perimeter_pentagon(a) should take a single parameter 'a' representing the length of a side of the regular pentagon.
