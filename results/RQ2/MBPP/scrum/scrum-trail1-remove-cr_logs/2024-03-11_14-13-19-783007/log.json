Additionally, we should consider creating separate test cases for different input validation scenarios, such as alphabetic input, special characters, and empty input.\\\",\\n  \\\"Developer\\\": \\\"As a Developer, I suggest revising the test cases to include more specific and detailed expected outputs. For example, instead of just 'False' for non-prime numbers, we could specify the factors of the number to help with debugging. Additionally, we should consider adding boundary test cases to cover the maximum and minimum possible input values for the parameter.\\\"\\n}\\n # Draft Test cases:\\n{\\n  \\\"requirement analysis\\\": \\\"analysis\\\",\\n  \\\"test_cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Test for prime number\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=13\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"True\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Test for non-prime number\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=4\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"False\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Test for edge case 0\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=0\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"False\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Test for edge case 1\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=1\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"False\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Test for negative number\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=-7\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"False\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Test for input validation\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1='abc'\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"ValueError\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction.
