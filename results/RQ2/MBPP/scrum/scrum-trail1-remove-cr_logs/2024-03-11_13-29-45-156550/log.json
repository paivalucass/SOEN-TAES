Additionally, I would recommend adding test cases for performance and scalability testing to validate the system's behavior under heavy load and large input arrays.\\\"\\n  ,\\n  \\\"Developer\\\": \\\"As a developer, I would suggest revising the test cases to include more descriptive and specific input data to cover a variety of scenarios. For example, the test case 'Valid input array with odd XOR pairs' could include a brief explanation of what an odd XOR pair is and how it relates to the input data. This will provide clearer guidance for writing the test cases and understanding the expected output.\\\"\\n}\\n # Draft Test cases:\\n{\\n  \\\"test_cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Valid input array with odd XOR pairs\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=[5,4,7,2,1], parameter2=5\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"6\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Empty input array\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=[], parameter2=0\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"0\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Input array with only one element\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=[3], parameter2=1\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"0\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Input array with all elements being the same\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=[2,2,2,2], parameter2=4\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"6\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Large input array\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=[1,2,3,...,100000], parameter2=100000\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"Even for large input\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction.
