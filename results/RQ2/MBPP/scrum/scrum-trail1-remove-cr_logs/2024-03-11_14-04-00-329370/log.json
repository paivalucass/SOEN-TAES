Analyze requirements and constraints: The function should take in a list of tuples as input and return a list of tuples containing combinations of sums. The input list may contain tuples of varying lengths and the function should be able to handle this variability.\n\n2. Consider scalability and performance implications: The function should be designed to handle large input lists efficiently and should be optimized for performance to ensure that it can scale with increasing data size without compromising on speed.\n\nHigh-level design:\n```python\ndef find_combinations(test_list):\n    # Write a function to find the combinations of sums with tuples in the given tuple list.\n    # https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-combinations-of-sum-with-tuples-in-tuple-list/\n    # assert find_combinations([(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]) == [(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]\n    # Your implementation here\n```\n\nThe design provides a high-level structure for the function and includes a reference link for the developer to understand the concept of finding combinations of sums with tuples in a tuple list.
