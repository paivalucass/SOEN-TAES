This approach ensures O(n) time complexity for finding duplicates.\n\nAdditionally, the function should be designed to handle edge cases, such as empty arrays or arrays with a single element, and provide appropriate error handling or validation.\n\nThe code should be well-documented to explain the technical approach and any assumptions made in the implementation.
