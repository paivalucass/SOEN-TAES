This will help ensure that the function can handle different edge cases. For the 'Unsorted Input List' test case, we should also add a test case with a sorted input list to validate that the function can handle both sorted and unsorted lists. For the 'Subarray Search' test case, we should add a test case where the subarray start and end indexes are out of range to ensure proper error handling.\\\"\\n\\n  ,\\n  \\\"Developer\\\": \\\"For the 'Empty Input List' test case, we should consider adding a test case with a non-empty input list to ensure that the function can handle lists of different sizes. For the 'Unsorted Input List' test case, we should also add a test case with a reverse-sorted input list to cover more edge cases. For the 'Subarray Search' test case, we should add a test case where the subarray start index is greater than the end index to validate proper error handling.\\\"\\n}\\n # Draft Test cases:\\n{\\n  \\\"test_cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Empty Input List\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"[]\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"None\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Unsorted Input List\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"[3, 2, 1]\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"Error Handling\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Subarray Search\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"array=[1, 2, 4, 5], start=1, end=3\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"3\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction.
