This will allow for easy scalability and maintenance.\\n\\n2. Performance Optimization: The architecture will focus on performance optimization to handle large datasets efficiently. This will involve utilizing appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient computation and storage of large datasets.\\n\\n3. Input/Output Handling: The architecture will define clear input and output specifications for the function, including details on the expected input format, output format, and any specific constraints or edge cases. This will guide the developer in writing code that accurately handles various input scenarios.\\n\\n4. Technology Stack: The choice of technology stack will align with the performance and scalability requirements. This may involve selecting programming languages, libraries, and frameworks known for their efficiency in handling large datasets and complex mathematical computations.\\n\\n5. Testing and Validation: The architecture will include provisions for testing and validation of the Eulerian number calculation function. This will involve defining comprehensive test cases, performance benchmarks, and validation criteria to ensure the function meets the specified requirements.\\n\\nWith these high-level design principles in mind, the developer can proceed to implement the eulerian_num(n, m) function, ensuring that the code adheres to the architectural guidelines and is optimized for performance and scalability.\", \"Question\": \"def eulerian_num(n, m): \\n'''Write a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m).\\nassert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4'''\\n\"}",
