The function should return a sorted list of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.\n\nHere is a high-level design for the function:\n\n```python\ndef maximum(arr, k):\n    # Sort the input array in descending order\n    arr.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Return the first k elements of the sorted array\n    return arr[:k]\n```\n\nThis design is focused on guiding the developer on the key steps to implement the function.

The developer can choose the most suitable sorting algorithm based on the constraints and suggestions provided.",
