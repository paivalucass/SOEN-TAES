Input validation to ensure that the input list contains only numerical values representing GPAs. This will help to prevent any unexpected input errors.\\n\\n2. Error handling for cases where the input list is empty or contains invalid GPAs. This will improve the robustness of the function.\\n\\n3. Use a dictionary to store the GPA to letter grade mapping for easier lookup, which will make the implementation of the grading table more efficient and maintainable.\\n\\nAdditionally, the function should be thoroughly tested with different combinations of GPAs to ensure that it returns the correct letter grades according to the provided grading table. Edge cases such as empty input lists, negative GPAs, and GPAs outside the range of 0 to 4 should be tested to ensure that the function handles them appropriately. Performance testing with large input lists should also be conducted to identify and address any potential performance issues.\\n\\nBy incorporating these suggestions, the new design will result in a more robust and reliable function for converting numerical GPAs to letter grades.\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction section.
