Inclusion of unit tests for the function to ensure its correctness, covering all possible scenarios, non-negative integers, edge cases such as 0 and 1, as well as larger input values.\\n3. Review of the implementation for potential performance issues, especially for larger input values, to ensure that the function can efficiently generate the first n prime numbers less than n.\\n\\nThe updated design should reflect these suggestions and provide a comprehensive guide for the developer to implement the function with the necessary features, functionality, and testing considerations.\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction section.
