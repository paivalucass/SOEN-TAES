The function will not \\n    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. \\n    \\n    Examples:\\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6\\n    For lst = []  the output should be 0\\n    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}"
