The `encode_shift` function takes a string as input and returns the encoded string after shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet. The `decode_shift` function takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string back to the original input. I have also included comments to explain the purpose of each function and the shifting logic applied to handle both lowercase and uppercase alphabetic characters.",
    "DesignMeetings": "{\n  \"Developer\": \"The functions `encode_shift` and `decode_shift` are implemented correctly, but we can improve the code readability by breaking down the logic into smaller, more understandable steps. We can also add some error handling to validate the input string and ensure it is not empty.\",\n  \"Tester\": \"We should test the functions with various input strings including empty string, string with only lowercase characters, string with only uppercase characters, and mixed case string to ensure the encoding and decoding is working as expected for all cases.

    "Design": "Based on the suggestions provided, I have made the following improvements to the design:\n\n```python\n# Function to encode a given string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet\ndef encode_shift(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Encode the input string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.\n\n    Args:\n    s: Input string to be encoded\n\n    Returns:\n    Encoded string\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Error handling to validate the input string and ensure it is not empty\n    if not s:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input string cannot be empty\")\n\n    # Use list comprehension to apply shifting logic to each character in the input string\n    # Use modulus operator to handle looping back to the beginning of the alphabet\n    encoded_str = \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord(\"a\")) % 26) + ord(\"a\")) if ch.islower() else chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord(\"A\")) % 26) + ord(\"A\")) if ch.isupper() else ch for ch in s])\n\n    return encoded_str\n\n# Function to decode the encoded string\ndef decode_shift(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Decode the encoded string back to the original input.\n\n    Args:\n    s: Encoded string to be decoded\n\n    Returns:\n    Decoded string\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Error handling to validate the input string and ensure it is not empty\n    if not s:\n        raise ValueError(\"Encoded string cannot be empty\")\n\n    # Use list comprehension to apply reverse shifting logic to each character in the encoded string\n    # Use modulus operator to handle looping back to the beginning of the alphabet\n    decoded_str = \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord(\"a\")) % 26) + ord(\"a\")) if ch.islower() else chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord(\"A\")) % 26) + ord(\"A\")) if ch.isupper() else ch for ch in s])\n\n    return decoded_str\n```\n\nIn the updated design, I have added error handling to validate the input string and ensure it is not empty for both the `encode_shift` and `decode_shift` functions.
