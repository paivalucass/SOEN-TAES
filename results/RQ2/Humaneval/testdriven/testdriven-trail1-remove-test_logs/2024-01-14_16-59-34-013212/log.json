The function should separate those groups into separate strings and return the list of those. The separate groups are balanced and not nested within each other. The function should ignore any spaces in the input string.\"\n}",

This will help to ensure that the function works as intended and does not encounter unexpected input.\",\n  \"Tester\": \"I recommend creating test cases for various input scenarios, such as empty string, single group of parentheses, multiple groups with different levels of nesting, and input with spaces. This will help to validate the functionality and identify any potential issues with the implementation.\"\n}"
