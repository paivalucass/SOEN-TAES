The last element of the array will be moved to\\n    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. \\n\\n    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation\\n    then return True else return False.\\n    If the given array is empty then return True.\\n\\n    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.\\n\\n    For Example:\\n    \\n    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True\\n    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can\\n                 be achieved for the given array.\\n    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False\\n    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given\\n                array by performing any number of right shift operations.\\n                \\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
