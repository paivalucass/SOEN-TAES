Create a dictionary to store the mapping of vowels to their replacements. For example, {'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'}\n4. Iterate through each character in the uppercase message.\n5. If the character is a letter, swap its case using the swapcase() method.\n6. If the character is a vowel, replace it with the corresponding value from the dictionary.\n7. Return the modified message.\n\nThis design provides a high-level overview of the steps the developer needs to take in order to implement the encode function. It focuses on the logic and algorithm rather than specific implementation details.",
