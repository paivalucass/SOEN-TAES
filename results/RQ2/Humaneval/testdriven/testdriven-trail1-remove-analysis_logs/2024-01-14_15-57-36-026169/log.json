Create a function add_elements(arr, k) that takes a non-empty array of integers arr and an integer k as input and returns the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.\n\n2. Validate the input parameters:\n   - Ensure arr is a non-empty array of integers.\n   - Ensure k is a positive integer and not greater than the length of arr.\n\n3. Initialize a variable sum = 0 to store the sum of elements with at most two digits.\n\n4. Iterate through the first k elements of arr:\n   - For each element, check if it has at most two digits (i.e., between 10 and 99).\n   - If the condition is met, add the element to the sum.\n\n5. Return the sum as the output.\n\nHigh-Level Design Explanation:\nThe design focuses on creating a function that takes input parameters, validates them, and then iterates through the array to calculate the sum based on the given condition. It provides a clear guideline for the developer to implement the logic without specifying the implementation details, allowing flexibility in the coding approach.",
