It returns a List[int] with the `delimeter` inserted between every two consecutive elements of the input list `numbers`.\n\nTo implement this, the developer should iterate through the input list `numbers` and insert the `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements. They can achieve this by using a loop or a list comprehension to iterate through `numbers` and insert the `delimeter` at the appropriate positions.\n\nIt's important to handle the edge case where the input list `numbers` is empty, in which case the function should return an empty list.\n\nThe developer should also include type annotations for the function parameters and return value to ensure type safety.
