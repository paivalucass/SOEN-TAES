To accomplish this, the following high-level design is recommended for the developer:\n\n1. Define a helper function to check if a number is prime. This function will take a number n as input and return a boolean indicating whether n is prime or not.\n\n2. Inside the x_or_y function, use the helper function to check if the input n is prime.\n\n3. If the helper function returns True, return the value of x. If it returns False, return the value of y.\n\nBy following this design, the developer can create a clear and efficient implementation of the x_or_y function that meets the specified requirement.",
