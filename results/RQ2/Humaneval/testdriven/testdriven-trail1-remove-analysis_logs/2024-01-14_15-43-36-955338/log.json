Remove any spaces from the input string using the string's replace method.\n3. Initialize an empty list to store the separate groups of parentheses.\n4. Use a while loop to iterate through the input string:\n    a. Initialize variables open_index and close_index to track the indices of the opening and closing parentheses.\n    b. Use the find method to find the indices of the opening and closing parentheses.\n    c. Use string slicing to extract the substring between open_index and close_index and append it to the list of separate groups.\n    d. Use the replace method to replace the extracted substring with an empty string in the input string.\n5. Return the list of separate groups.\n\nNote: This design provides a high-level approach to solving the problem and guides the developer in writing code to implement the logic described. It does not provide specific implementation details such as variable names or exact syntax.",
