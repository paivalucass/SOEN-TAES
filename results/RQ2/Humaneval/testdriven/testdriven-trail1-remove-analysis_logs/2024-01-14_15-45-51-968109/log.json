    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\n1. Function Name: largest_divisor\n2. Input: n (int)\n3. Output: int\n4. Description: \n   - The function largest_divisor takes an integer n as input and returns the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n.\n   - If the input number n is 15, the largest number that divides 15 evenly and is smaller than 15 is 5.\n\nHigh-Level Algorithm:\n1. Initialize a variable largest_divisor to 1.\n2. Iterate from 1 to n-1.\n3. For each number i in the iteration, check if n is divisible by i with no remainder.\n4. If n is divisible by i with no remainder, update largest_divisor to i.\n5. Return the value of largest_divisor as the output.\n\nNote: The algorithm should be implemented considering edge cases such as negative numbers, zero, and large numbers. Use appropriate error handling and data validation techniques.\n\nGuidelines for Developer:\n- Use a loop to iterate from 1 to n-1 to find the largest divisor.\n- Check for divisibility using the modulo operator.\n- Update the largest_divisor variable whenever a larger divisor is found.\n- Handle edge cases such as negative numbers, zero, and large numbers to ensure the function's robustness.\n\nBy following these high-level guidelines, the developer can implement the largest_divisor function effectively and efficiently.",
    "DesignMeetings": "{\n  \"Developer\": \"The algorithm provided in the context seems to be a straightforward and effective approach to finding the largest divisor. It covers the basic steps required to implement the function. However, it would be beneficial to include specific error handling and data validation techniques for edge cases like negative numbers, zero, and large numbers. Additionally, considering the use of appropriate variable names and comments for better code readability would be helpful.\"\n}",
