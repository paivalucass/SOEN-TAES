The function should follow the below steps to achieve the desired result:\n\n1. Create a new list l' to store the modified values.\n2. Iterate through the input list l and for each even index i, extract the value and add it to a temporary list.\n3. Sort the temporary list in ascending order.\n4. Iterate through the input list l again and for each index i, if i is even, append the sorted value from the temporary list to the new list l', otherwise append the original value from the input list l.\n5. Return the new list l'.\n\nThis high-level design guides the developer to think about the approach and logic required to implement the sort_even function without providing specific implementation details. It focuses on the overall process and steps needed to achieve the desired functionality.",
