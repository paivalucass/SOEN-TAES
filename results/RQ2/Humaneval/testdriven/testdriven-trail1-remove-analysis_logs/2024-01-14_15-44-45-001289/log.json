The algorithm involves recursively applying the formula gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b) until b becomes 0. At that point, the value of a is the greatest common divisor.\n\nIn addition, the greatest_common_divisor function should include type hints for the parameters and the return value, specifying that they are all integers.\n\nThe function should also include a docstring that provides a brief description of the function and its purpose, as well as example usage and expected output.\n\nOverall, the greatest_common_divisor function should be designed to be efficient, easy to understand, and flexible for use in different contexts.",
