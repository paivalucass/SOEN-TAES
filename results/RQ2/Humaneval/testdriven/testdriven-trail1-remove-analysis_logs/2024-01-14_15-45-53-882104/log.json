    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\nThe factorize function takes an integer n as input and returns a list of prime factors of n in ascending order, with each factor listed the number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in the factorization.\n\nThe function should first check if n is 1, in which case it should return an empty list as 1 has no prime factors. If n is less than 1, the function should raise a ValueError.\n\nTo factorize n, the function can use a loop to iterate through numbers from 2 up to the square root of n. For each number, check if it is a factor of n. If it is, divide n by the number and add the number to the list of factors. Continue this process until n is no longer divisible by the current number.\n\nAfter the loop, if n is greater than 1, it means that the remaining value of n is also a prime factor, so add it to the list.\n\nFinally, return the list of prime factors.\n\nThe developer should also include appropriate error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases. Additionally, the developer should consider optimizing the algorithm for larger input values to ensure efficient performance.",
