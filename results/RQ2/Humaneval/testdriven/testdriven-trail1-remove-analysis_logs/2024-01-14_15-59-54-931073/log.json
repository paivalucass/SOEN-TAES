Inside the file_name_check function, perform the following validation checks:\n   - Check if there are not more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.\n   - Check if the file's name contains exactly one dot '.'.\n   - Check if the substring before the dot is not empty and starts with a letter from the Latin alphabet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').\n   - Check if the substring after the dot is one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll'].\n\n3. Finally, return 'Yes' or 'No' based on the validation checks.\n\nExample Usage:\nfile_name_check(\"example.txt\") # => 'Yes'\nfile_name_check(\"1example.dll\") # => 'No' (the name should start with a Latin alphabet letter)",
