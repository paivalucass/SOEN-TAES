    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\nThe correct_bracketing function will take a string of brackets as input and return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The function will return False if there are any mismatched brackets.\n\nThe developer should start by initializing a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. Then, they should iterate through the input string and for each character, check if it is an opening bracket. If it is, they should push it onto the stack. If it is a closing bracket, they should check if the stack is empty (indicating a mismatch) or if the top of the stack contains the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is not met, they should return False.\n\nAfter iterating through the entire input string, if the stack is empty, the developer should return True, indicating that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket. Otherwise, they should return False.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\ndef correct_bracketing(brackets: str):\n    stack = []\n    for char in brackets:\n        if char == '(':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == ')':\n            if not stack:\n                return False\n            if stack[-1] == '(':\n                stack.pop()\n            else:\n                return False\n    return not stack\n```",
