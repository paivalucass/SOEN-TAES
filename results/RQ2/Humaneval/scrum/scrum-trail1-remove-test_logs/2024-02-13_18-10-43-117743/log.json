It should then determine whether it is possible to exchange elements between lst1 and lst2 to make all the elements of lst1 to be even. If it is possible, the function should return \\\"YES\\\", otherwise, it should return \\\"NO\\\".\\n\\nIn order to achieve algorithmic efficiency, efficient data structures such as hash maps or sets will be used to track the count of even and odd numbers in each list. This will enable quick determination of whether it is possible to exchange elements to make lst1 a list of only even numbers. Additionally, the function will be implemented using an efficient algorithm such as the two-pointer approach to manipulate the lists.\\n\\nThe design will also include thorough testing with non-empty input lists of different lengths, lists with both even and odd numbers, and empty lists to ensure that it handles all edge cases properly. Boundary testing will be performed with extreme input values to check for unexpected behavior and ensure that error handling is robust.\\n\\nThis revised design takes into account the suggestions provided and aims to address the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of the function.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef exchange(lst1, lst2):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,\\n    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements\\n    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.\\n    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.\\n    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make\\n    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return \\\"YES\\\".\\n    Otherwise, return \\\"NO\\\".\\n    For example:\\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => \\\"YES\\\"\\n    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => \\\"NO\\\"\\n    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
