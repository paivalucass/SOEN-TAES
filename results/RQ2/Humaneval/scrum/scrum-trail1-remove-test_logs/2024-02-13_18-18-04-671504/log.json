Additionally, I want to incorporate input validation and error handling mechanisms within the interface design to address different user scenarios. I also want to prioritize testing for various inputs such as empty string, special characters, long strings, and edge cases to ensure comprehensive test coverage. Furthermore, I want to incorporate automated testing tools and frameworks to streamline the testing process and improve efficiency in testing the 'solve' function.\\\"\\n   \\t\\t\\n     \\t\\n   \\t \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n\\n# Tasks:\\n['Create test cases for letter reversal scenario', 'Create test cases for non-letter reversal scenario']\\n# Design:\\nDesign:\\nThe new design for the 'solve' function will incorporate the following components:\\n\\n1. Input Validation:\\n   - Utilize regular expressions for efficient validation of non-empty strings.\\n\\n2. Processing Logic:\\n   - Employ built-in string manipulation functions for improved performance instead of iterating through the input string character by character.\\n   - Use a switch statement to handle different cases for character reversal.\\n\\n3. Error Handling:\\n   - Implement try-catch blocks for handling exceptions and providing informative error messages.\\n\\n4. Testing:\\n   - Utilize unit testing frameworks like Jest to write test cases for different scenarios such as empty strings, special characters, and long strings.\\n\\nBy incorporating these changes, the 'solve' function will have enhanced input validation, improved processing logic, robust error handling, and comprehensive testing coverage.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef solve(s):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"You are given a string s.\\n    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, \\n    otherwise keep it as it is.\\n    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.\\n    The function should return the resulted string.\\n    Examples\\n    solve(\\\"1234\\\") = \\\"4321\\\"\\n    solve(\\\"ab\\\") = \\\"AB\\\"\\n    solve(\\\"#a@C\\\") = \\\"#A@c\\\"\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
