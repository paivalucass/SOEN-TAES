Data Structure:\\n   - I suggest using a combination of arrays and hash maps to efficiently store and manipulate the cars' positions and directions. This will allow for easy access and manipulation of the cars' movements to calculate the collisions.\\n\\n2. Algorithm:\\n   - I recommend using a combination of sorting and iteration to efficiently calculate the number of collisions between the cars driving in opposite directions. This will consider the positions and directions of the cars to accurately determine the collisions.\\n\\n3. Scalability and Efficiency:\\n   - The algorithm and data structure should be designed with scalability and efficiency in mind to handle large amounts of data. This includes optimizing the code for performance and ensuring that it can handle varying numbers of cars and different scenarios such as varying car speeds and edge cases.\\n\\n4. Testing and Automation:\\n   - Thorough unit tests for different scenarios should be implemented to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the function. Automation of the testing process should be considered to efficiently run tests with different input parameters and verify the accuracy of the collision calculations.\\n\\nBy following this revised design, the developer will have clear guidance on how to implement the function for calculating the number of collisions between cars driving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\\n    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\\n    are driving right to left.
