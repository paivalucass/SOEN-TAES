Edge cases such as long input strings and special characters will also be tested. Additionally, the user experience of the input interface will be validated to ensure it is simple and intuitive for entering the string of words.\\n\\nThe architecture will prioritize user experience enhancements to create a simple and intuitive user interface for inputting a string of words and getting the count of boredoms in a clear and easily understandable manner.
