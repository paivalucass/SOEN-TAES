The function should return a boolean value indicating whether the input text is a palindrome or not.\\n- The function should first ensure that the input parameter is properly validated to handle edge cases such as empty string or null input. It should then use efficient string manipulation techniques to remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert the input text to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparison.\\n- The function should implement a well-optimized algorithm to check for palindrome that meets the O(n) time complexity requirement. It should compare the original text with its reverse and return True if they are the same, indicating that the input text is a palindrome. Otherwise, it should return False.\\n- The function should handle empty strings and single-character strings as special cases and return True for both.\\n- The function should be tested with various input texts including empty string, single-character string, and normal palindrome and non-palindrome strings. It should also be tested to handle non-alphanumeric characters and case-insensitive comparison correctly. Performance testing with large input texts should be performed to ensure the function meets the O(n) time complexity requirement.\\n- The code should be clear and concise with appropriate comments and documentation to enhance the user-friendly interface of the function. Feedback on the user-friendliness of the function interface should be provided and any improvements for clarity and ease of use should be suggested.\\n\\nThis design will guide the developer in writing code that meets these requirements.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef is_palindrome(text: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Checks if given string is a palindrome\\n    >>> is_palindrome('')\\n    True\\n    >>> is_palindrome('aba')\\n    True\\n    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')\\n    True\\n    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')\\n    False\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
