Edge cases such as n = 0 and n = 1 should be tested to verify the function handles them correctly. Also, testing for invalid inputs should be conducted to ensure proper error handling.\\n\\nThe algorithmic approach is designed to handle both even and odd values of n and prioritizes readability and maintainability.
