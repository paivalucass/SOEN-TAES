Implement a separate function to calculate the area of the triangle using the given side lengths.\\n- If the sides form a valid triangle, the function should calculate the area of the triangle and round it to 2 decimal points. Verify that the function returns the correct area value rounded to 2 decimal points.\\n- If the sides do not form a valid triangle, the function should return -1. Use exception handling to handle invalid inputs.\\n- The function should have clear input and output specifications, as well as examples to illustrate its usage. Include comments to explain the logic and calculations in the code.\\n- It should prioritize accuracy and reliability by including unit tests to ensure the correctness of the output.\\n- Test the function with different sets of side lengths to cover all possible scenarios (valid triangle, invalid triangle, negative input, zero input). Check for any potential edge cases and boundary conditions. Review the unit tests to ensure comprehensive coverage of different cases.\\n\\nThis updated design incorporates the suggestions provided by the developer and tester, ensuring that the triangle_area function is robust, accurate, and thoroughly tested.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef triangle_area(a, b, c):\\n    '''\\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
