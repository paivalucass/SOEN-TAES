This approach will ensure that unnecessary operations and iterations are minimized, optimizing the implementation for performance.\\n\\nAdditionally, the function will be tested with large input arrays to assess its scalability and performance. Boundary value testing and negative testing will be performed to cover various input scenarios and edge cases. Error handling for input validation will be included to ensure correct output and validate the handling of various input scenarios.\\n\\nOverall, the design will guide the developer in writing code that efficiently finds the maximum k numbers in an array, optimizes performance, and handles various input scenarios to ensure correctness and scalability of the system.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef maximum(arr, k):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list \\n    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.\\n\\n    Example 1:\\n\\n        Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3\\n        Output: [-4, -3, 5]\\n\\n    Example 2:\\n\\n        Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2\\n        Output: [4, 4]\\n\\n    Example 3:\\n\\n        Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1\\n        Output: [2]\\n\\n    Note:\\n        1.
