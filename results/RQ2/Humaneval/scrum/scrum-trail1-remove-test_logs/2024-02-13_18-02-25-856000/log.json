This would involve storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations and improve the overall time complexity of the computation. Additionally, I would recommend breaking down the computation into smaller, reusable functions to improve modularity and maintainability.\\n\\nHere is a revised high-level design approach for the efficient computation of the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence:\\n\\n1. Define a function fibfib(n: int) to efficiently compute the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence using dynamic programming.\\n2. Implement base cases where fibfib(0) returns 0, fibfib(1) returns 0, and fibfib(2) returns 1.\\n3. Use dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations in the recursive approach to calculate fibfib(n) as fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).\\n4. Break down the computation into smaller, reusable functions to improve modularity and maintainability.\\n5. Optimize the algorithm for efficiency to handle large inputs effectively.\\n\\nBy following this revised high-level design, the developer can focus on implementing the efficient computation of the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence using dynamic programming while ensuring scalability and performance. Additionally, thorough testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and boundary testing, should be conducted to validate the correctness and efficiency of the algorithm.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef fibfib(n: int):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"The FibFib number sequence is a sequence similar to the Fibbonacci sequnece that's defined as follows:\\n    fibfib(0) == 0\\n    fibfib(1) == 0\\n    fibfib(2) == 1\\n    fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).\\n    Please write a function to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence.\\n    >>> fibfib(1)\\n    0\\n    >>> fibfib(5)\\n    4\\n    >>> fibfib(8)\\n    24\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
