Additionally, I want to prioritize the user stories for the remove_vowels function so that the development team can focus on the most important requirements first. Furthermore, I want to define acceptance criteria for the remove_vowels function to ensure that the function meets the specified requirements and behaves as expected.\\\"\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n\\n# Tasks:\\n['Write test cases for remove_vowels function to ensure thorough testing coverage']\\n# Design:\\nBased on the suggestions, I have updated the design for the remove_vowels function as follows:\\n\\nDesign for remove_vowels function:\\n\\nThe remove_vowels function should take a single parameter 'text', which is a string, and return a string without any vowels.\\n\\nHigh-level design:\\n1. Define a function named remove_vowels that takes a string parameter 'text'.\\n2. Add validation to ensure that the 'text' parameter is a valid string before processing it.\\n3. Create a new string variable to store the result without vowels.\\n4. Iterate through each character in the 'text' parameter and check if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).\\n5. If the character is not a vowel, append it to the result string.\\n6. Write test cases to cover different scenarios, such as empty string, strings with only vowels, strings with no vowels, and special characters.\\n7. This can help prevent potential errors or unexpected behavior in the function and ensure that the function works as expected in various situations.\\n8. Return the result string without vowels.\\n\\nThis updated design includes validation for the 'text' parameter and test cases to cover different scenarios, as suggested by the developer and tester.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef remove_vowels(text):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    remove_vowels is a function that takes string and returns string without vowels.\\n    >>> remove_vowels('')\\n    ''\\n    >>> remove_vowels(\\\"abcdef\\\\nghijklm\\\")\\n    'bcdf\\\\nghjklm'\\n    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')\\n    'bcdf'\\n    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')\\n    ''\\n    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')\\n    'B'\\n    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')\\n    'zbcd'\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
