It should also have error handling for invalid inputs and should follow a consistent design with the rest of the application. As a tester, I would suggest testing the user interface with different combinations of input values to ensure that the greatest common divisor is calculated accurately. Additionally, testing for edge cases and invalid inputs is important to ensure the robustness of the interface.\\\"\\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\n# Tasks:\\n['Consider edge cases and test for different input values in the greatest_common_divisor function']\\n# Design:\\nBased on the suggestions provided, I have updated the design as follows:\\n\\nFunction:\\n```python\\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\\n    # Implementation of Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor\\n    while b:\\n        a, b = b, a % b\\n    return abs(a)\\n```\\n\\nUser Interface:\\n- Clear input fields for the two integers\\n- Button to trigger the calculation\\n- Display area for the output\\n- Error handling for invalid inputs\\n- Consistent design with the rest of the application\\n\\nTesting:\\n- Testing with different combinations of input values\\n- Testing for edge cases and invalid inputs to ensure robustness and reliability\\n\\nThank you for the suggestions, and I believe this updated design will address the efficiency, accuracy, and user experience aspects effectively.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b\\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)\\n    1\\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)\\n    5\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
