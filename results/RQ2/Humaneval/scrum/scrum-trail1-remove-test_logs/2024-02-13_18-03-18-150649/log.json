The pluck function should take an array representing a branch of a tree with non-negative integer nodes as input and return the node with the smallest even value along with its index. If multiple nodes have the same smallest even value, the node with the smallest index should be returned. If there are no even values or the array is empty, an empty list should be returned. The function should also adhere to the following constraints: 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000 and 0 <= node.value. It is further clarified that the expected input format should be an array representing a branch of a tree with non-negative integer nodes as input. Error handling requirements for the pluck function should be specified. It would also be valuable to provide example test cases to ensure that the pluck function meets the specified requirements. Additionally, clarification on the expected behavior for edge cases, such as an empty input array or an array with all odd values, would aid in testing the function.\\\"\\n   \\n \\t\\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\n# Tasks:\\n['Run test cases with both even and odd values to ensure correct output']\\n# Design:\\n```python\\n# pluck function to return the smallest even value and its index\\ndef pluck(arr):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Given an array representing a branch of a tree with non-negative integer nodes,\\n    the pluck function returns the node with the smallest even value along with its index.\\n    \\n    If multiple nodes have the same smallest even value, the node with the smallest index is returned.\\n    If there are no even values or the array is empty, an empty list is returned.\\n\\n    Example 1:\\n        Input: [4,2,3]\\n        Output: [2, 1]\\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\\n\\n    Example 2:\\n        Input: [1,2,3]\\n        Output: [2, 1]\\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\\n\\n    Example 3:\\n        Input: []\\n        Output: []\\n    \\n    Example 4:\\n        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]\\n        Output: [0, 3]\\n        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, and the first occurrence of 0 at index 3 is returned.\\n\\n    Constraints:\\n        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000\\n        * 0 <= node.value\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n    # Error handling for empty arrays\\n    if len(arr) == 0:\\n        return []\\n\\n    # Error handling for arrays with no even values\\n    even_values = [x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0]\\n    if len(even_values) == 0:\\n        return []\\n\\n    # Finding the smallest even value and its index\\n    smallest_even = min(even_values)\\n    smallest_even_index = arr.index(smallest_even)\\n\\n    return [smallest_even, smallest_even_index]\\n```\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef pluck(arr):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    \\\"Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes\\n    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.\\n    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.\\n    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.\\n\\n    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],\\n    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].\\n\\n    Example 1:\\n        Input: [4,2,3]\\n        Output: [2, 1]\\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\\n\\n    Example 2:\\n        Input: [1,2,3]\\n        Output: [2, 1]\\n        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. \\n\\n    Example 3:\\n        Input: []\\n        Output: []\\n    \\n    Example 4:\\n        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]\\n        Output: [0, 1]\\n        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,\\n                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.\\n\\n    Constraints:\\n        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000\\n        * 0 <= node.value\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
