For the 'Only Uppercase Vowels at Even Indices' test case, validate the code's ability to count only uppercase vowels at even indices.\\\"\\n}\\n # Draft Test cases:\\n{\\n  \\\"test_cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Empty Input\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1='', parameter2=''\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"0\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"No Uppercase Vowels at Even Indices\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1='abcdefg', parameter2=''\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"0\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Uppercase Vowels at Even Indices\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1='aBCdEf', parameter2=''\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"1\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Only Uppercase Vowels at Even Indices\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1='ABCD', parameter2=''\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"2\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction.
