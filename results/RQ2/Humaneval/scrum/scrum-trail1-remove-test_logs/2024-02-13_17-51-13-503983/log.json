The function should implement a linear transformation that maps the smallest number in the input list to 0 and the largest number to 1. \\n\\nThe function should handle input lists with at least two elements and return a list of the same length as the input. Error handling should be implemented to check if the input list has at least two elements and handle edge cases, such as when all elements in the input list are the same.\\n\\nThe function signature should be:\\n```python\\nfrom typing import List\\n\\ndef rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    This function takes a list of numbers and returns a rescaled list of numbers.\\n    \\n    Parameters:\\n    numbers (List[float]): Input list of numbers\\n    \\n    Returns:\\n    List[float]: Rescaled list of numbers\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n    # Implementation details and algorithm for linear transformation\\n\\n    # Example usage:\\n    # input_list = [1, 2, 3]\\n    # rescaled_list = rescale_to_unit(input_list)\\n    # Expected output: [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]\\n```\\n\\nThe function should have clear and descriptive docstrings that explain its purpose and usage, including example usage along with expected output to guide the developers in understanding the functionality. Additionally, error handling and edge cases should be documented to guide the developers in writing robust code.
