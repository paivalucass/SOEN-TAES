Verify that the function returns the correct result for all the acceptance criteria tests mentioned in the context.\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Write test cases for different scenarios', 'Ensure function works as expected']\\n# Design:\\nBased on the suggestions provided by the developer and tester, I have revised the design for the function triples_sum_to_zero:\\n\\nThe function should be designed to efficiently find three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. To achieve this, I will use a hash table to store the elements and their complements, utilizing a language-specific data structure like a dictionary in Python or an unordered_map in C++. This will allow for quick look-up of complements and improve the time complexity of the function.\\n\\nIn addition, I will consider handling edge cases such as duplicates in the list and large input sizes to ensure the efficiency of the function. \\n\\nAs suggested by the tester, the function will be thoroughly tested with different types of input lists, including empty lists, lists with positive and negative numbers, and lists with duplicate elements. Testing will also include large input sizes to ensure efficient performance. Furthermore, edge cases where it is not possible to find three distinct elements that sum to zero will be tested to validate the handling of such scenarios.\\n\\nOverall, the revised design incorporates the suggestions provided and aims to implement an efficient solution for the given requirement.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.\\n    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that\\n    sum to zero, and False otherwise.\\n\\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])\\n    False\\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])\\n    True\\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])\\n    False\\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])\\n    True\\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])\\n    False\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
