If no commas exist either, the function should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet, where ord('a') = 0, ord('b') = 1, ... ord('z') = 25. The function should handle different input cases and provide the expected output as per the given examples. The function split_words(txt) should be designed to handle different input cases, including strings with whitespace, strings with commas, and strings with no whitespace or commas. It should also be designed to return the expected output as per the given examples. This can be achieved by using conditional statements to check for the presence of whitespace and commas in the input string, and then splitting the string accordingly. As a tester, I would suggest creating test cases for the function split_words(txt) to cover different input scenarios, including strings with whitespace, strings with commas, and strings with no whitespace or commas. Test cases should also include input with different cases of letters to ensure that the function handles them properly and returns the expected output.\\\"\\n \\t  \\n \\t  \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t      \\n \\t\\n# Tasks:\\n[]\\n# Design:\\nBased on the suggestions provided by the developer and tester, I have revised the design of the `split_words` function to include input validation and test cases for different input scenarios.\\n\\n```python\\ndef split_words(txt):\\n    if not isinstance(txt, str):\\n        return \\\"Invalid input: Please provide a valid string input\\\"\\n    if ' ' in txt:\\n        return txt.split(' ')\\n    elif ',' in txt:\\n        return txt.split(',')\\n    else:\\n        count = 0\\n        for char in txt:\\n            if char.islower() and ord(char) % 2 != 0:\\n                count += 1\\n        return count\\n```\\n\\nIn this revised design, I have added input validation to handle non-string input as suggested by the developer.
