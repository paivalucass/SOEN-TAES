The error is related to an AttributeError caused by an 'int' object not having the attribute 'islower'. This suggests that the code did not pass the test.\n\nRecommendation:\nThe code needs to be reviewed and modified to address the AttributeError and ensure that the test_check_dict_case function works as expected."
