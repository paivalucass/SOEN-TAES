It converts the input string to lowercase and then generates a set of unique characters after removing any non-alphanumeric characters. The function then returns the length of the unique characters set.\n\nThe test script output shows that the code has passed the tests, and the function is working correctly. Therefore, the conclusion is that the code test has passed."
