Compare the sorted strings to check if they are the same.\\n5. Return True if the sorted strings are the same, and False if they are different.\\n\\nSpecific Implementation Details:\\n- Handle empty strings: Add a check at the beginning of the function to handle empty input strings and return an error message if either s0 or s1 is empty.\\n- Error Handling: Implement error handling for unexpected input types, such as numbers or special characters, and provide clear error messages for the user.\\n- Data Structures and Methods: Utilize built-in string manipulation methods for converting to lowercase, removing non-alphabetic characters, and sorting the strings to optimize performance.\\n\\nTest Cases and Expected Outputs:\\n- Create test cases to cover various scenarios, including empty input strings, non-alphabetic characters, and different combinations of input strings to ensure the function is working as intended.\\n- Define the expected outputs for each test case to verify the correct behavior of the function.\\n\\nExample:\\n```python\\ndef same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):\\n    if not s0 or not s1:\\n        return \\\"Error: Input strings cannot be empty\\\"\\n        \\n    if not s0.isalpha() or not s1.isalpha():\\n        return \\\"Error: Input strings can only contain alphabetic characters\\\"\\n        \\n    s0 = s0.lower()\\n    s1 = s1.lower()\\n    \\n    s0 = ''.join(filter(str.isalpha, s0))\\n    s1 = ''.join(filter(str.isalpha, s1))\\n    \\n    s0 = ''.join(sorted(s0))\\n    s1 = ''.join(sorted(s1))\\n    \\n    return s0 == s1\\n```\\n\\nThis design includes specific implementation details for handling empty strings, error handling for unexpected input types, and utilizing appropriate data structures and methods for string manipulation and comparison. Additionally, it incorporates test cases and expected outputs to ensure the function's functionality is thoroughly tested and verified.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Check if two words have the same characters.\\n    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')\\n    True\\n    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')\\n    True\\n    >>> same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')\\n    True\\n    >>> same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')\\n    False\\n    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')\\n    False\\n    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')\\n    False\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
