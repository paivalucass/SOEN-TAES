Complete the following code:\n\ndef by_length(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,\n    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from\n    \"One\", \"Two\", \"Three\", \"Four\", \"Five\", \"Six\", \"Seven\", \"Eight\", \"Nine\".\n\n    For example:\n      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   \n            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] \n            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n      return [\"Eight\", \"Five\", \"Four\", \"Three\", \"Two\", \"Two\", \"One\", \"One\"]\n    \n      If the array is empty, return an empty array:\n      arr = []\n      return []\n    \n      If the array has any strange number ignore it:\n      arr = [1, -1 , 55] \n            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]\n            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]\n      return = ['One']\n    \"\"\"\n"
