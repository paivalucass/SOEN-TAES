Edge cases: The function should handle edge cases such as when n is a prime number or when n is 1. It should also have error handling for invalid input (e.g. non-integer inputs).\n\n2. Efficiency: The function should be implemented in a way that it efficiently finds the largest divisor without unnecessary iterations. This could involve using mathematical properties or algorithms to optimize the process of finding the largest divisor.\n\n3. Testing: The function should be thoroughly tested with various input values such as prime numbers, composite numbers, and edge cases like 1 and non-integer inputs. The testing should check if the function returns the correct largest divisor for each input and if it handles errors appropriately.\n\nHigh-Level Design for largest_divisor function:\n\n```python\ndef largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    # Add error handling for non-integer inputs\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be an integer\")\n\n    # Handle edge case when n is 1\n    if n == 1:\n        return None  # or handle it based on the requirement\n\n    # Handle edge case when n is a prime number\n    if is_prime(n):\n        return None  # or handle it based on the requirement\n\n    # Efficiently find the largest divisor\n    largest_div = 1\n    for i in range(2, int(n/2) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            largest_div = i\n\n    return largest_div\n```\n\nThis design provides a high-level outline for the largest_divisor function, addressing the edge cases, efficiency, and error handling as per the requirements.
