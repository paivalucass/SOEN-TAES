The test input [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4] should have returned True according to the function's specification, but it returned False instead. This indicates that the function is not working as expected for this input.\n\nRecommendation:\nThe code for the is_sorted function needs to be reviewed and debugged to ensure that it correctly handles the given input and returns the expected output.\n\nCode Test Failed"
