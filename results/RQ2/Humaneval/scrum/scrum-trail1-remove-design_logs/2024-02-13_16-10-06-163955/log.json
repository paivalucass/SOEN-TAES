For example, we could add test cases with very large input lists or very small input lists to ensure the function handles extreme cases correctly. Additionally, we could add test cases with negative numbers in the input list to test the function's handling of negative weights.\\\"\\n  ,\\n  \\\"Developer\\\": \\\"As a Developer, I would suggest revising the test cases to include more descriptive test titles that clearly indicate the scenario being tested. For example, instead of 'Unbalanced List', we could use 'Input list sum less than parameter2' to make it easier to understand the purpose of the test case. Additionally, we could revise the Expected Output values to be more specific, such as 'Expected Output: False (Input list sum < parameter2)' to provide more context for the expected result.\\\"\\n}\\n # Draft Test cases:\\n{\\n  \\\"test_cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Empty Input List\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=[],parameter2=5\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"False\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Unbalanced List\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=[1,2,3,4],parameter2=10\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"False\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Balanced List with Maximum Weight Exceeded\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=[3,2,3],parameter2=6\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"False\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Balanced List with Maximum Weight Not Exceeded\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=[3,2,3],parameter2=9\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"True\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Single Element List\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=[3],parameter2=5\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"True\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction.
