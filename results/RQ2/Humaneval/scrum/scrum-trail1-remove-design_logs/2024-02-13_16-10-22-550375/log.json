The requirement is to create a function called smallest_change that takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. Additionally, the function should allow for one change to be made to one element in the array. The function should have the following behavior: \\\\n- smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) should return 4\\\\n- smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) should return 1\\\\n- smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) should return 0\\\"\\n    \\t\\n    \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n   \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n  \\t\\n\\n# Tasks:\\n['Conduct thorough testing with different arrays', 'Ensure smallest_change function works accurately']\\n\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef smallest_change(arr):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that\\n    need to be changed to make the array palindromic.
