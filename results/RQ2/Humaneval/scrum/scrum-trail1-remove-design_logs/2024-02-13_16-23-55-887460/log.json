This includes adding clear and detailed error messages for different types of input errors and implementing user-friendly input validation to guide users towards correct inputs. Test cases for various input scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, should be created to ensure that the input validation and error handling functions as expected. Additionally, we should focus on testing the user experience when encountering input errors to ensure they can easily understand and correct the errors.\\\"\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\n# Tasks:\\n['Write test cases for both positive and negative scenarios', 'Ensure the function handles all input types correctly']\\n\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef sum_squares(lst):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"You are given a list of numbers.\\n    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,\\n    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.\\n    Examples:\\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14\\n    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98\\n    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84\\n    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29\\n    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6\\n    \\n\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
