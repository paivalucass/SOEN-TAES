Create a function fizz_buzz(n: int) which takes an integer n as input and returns the count of occurrences of the digit 7 in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\\n\\n2. Inside the fizz_buzz function, we will break down the functionality into smaller, more modular functions to improve readability and maintainability. We will optimize the iteration process to only check numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13 for the occurrence of the digit 7, rather than iterating through all numbers less than n.\\n\\n3. The tester's suggestion of writing test cases to cover different scenarios, such as n being a small number, a large number, or a negative number will be incorporated. We will also validate the output of the function against the expected count of occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\\n\\n4. For integers that are divisible by 11 or 13, we will count the occurrences of the digit 7 in the integer. If the count is greater than 0, we will increment a counter variable to keep track of the total occurrences.\\n\\n5. Finally, the total count of occurrences of the digit 7 in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13 will be returned.\\n\\nBy following this revised design, the developer can implement the code to achieve the desired functionality while also improving readability, maintainability, and test coverage.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.\\n    >>> fizz_buzz(50)\\n    0\\n    >>> fizz_buzz(78)\\n    2\\n    >>> fizz_buzz(79)\\n    3\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
