It would also be beneficial to include test cases with special characters or punctuation in the input data to ensure the functionality is robust and can handle various types of input.\\\",\\n  \\\"Developer\\\": \\\"As a Developer, I suggest revising the test cases to include more descriptive test titles that specify the purpose of the test. For example, instead of just 'Valid input', the test titles could be more specific such as 'Valid input with multiple occurrences' or 'Valid input with one word sentence'. This will make it easier to understand the purpose of each test case.\\\"\\n}\\n # Draft Test cases:\\n{\\n  \\\"test_cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Valid input\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"sentence = \\\\\\\"This is a test\\\\\\\"\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"is\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Valid input\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"sentence = \\\\\\\"lets go for swimming\\\\\\\"\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"go for\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Empty input\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"sentence = \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Invalid input\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"sentence = 123\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"Invalid input\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction.
