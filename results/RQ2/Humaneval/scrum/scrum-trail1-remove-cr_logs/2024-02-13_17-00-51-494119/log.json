Function Name: sumOfUpperCaseAscii\\n2. Input:\\n   - A string with potential non-alphabetic characters\\n3. Output:\\n   - The sum of the ASCII codes of the uppercase characters only\\n4. Utilize the map function to iterate through the string and calculate the sum of the ASCII values for the uppercase characters\\n5. Considerations:\\n   - Handle potential non-alphabetic characters in the input string\\n   - Return 0 if the input string is empty\\n   - Provide clear and specific examples to validate the function's output\\n   - Add parameter type checking to ensure the input is a string\\n   - Include more detailed comments in the code to explain the logic behind the implementation\\n   - Test for edge cases such as an input string with only non-alphabetic characters, an input string with only lowercase characters, and an input string with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, and non-alphabetic characters\\n6. High-level pseudocode:\\n   - Initialize a variable to store the sum of ASCII codes of uppercase characters\\n   - Iterate through the input string using the map function\\n   - For each character, check if it is an uppercase character and if it is a letter using the isupper() and isalpha() functions\\n   - If it is an uppercase letter, calculate its ASCII value and add it to the sum\\n   - Return the sum of ASCII codes of the uppercase characters\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```python\\ndef sumOfUpperCaseAscii(s):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Task\\n    Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the upper characters only\\n    ASCII codes.\\n\\n    Examples:\\n        sumOfUpperCaseAscii(\\\"\\\") => 0\\n        sumOfUpperCaseAscii(\\\"abAB\\\") => 131\\n        sumOfUpperCaseAscii(\\\"abcCd\\\") => 67\\n        sumOfUpperCaseAscii(\\\"helloE\\\") => 69\\n        sumOfUpperCaseAscii(\\\"woArBld\\\") => 131\\n        sumOfUpperCaseAscii(\\\"aAaaaXa\\\") => 153\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef digitSum(s):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Task\\n    Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the upper characters only'\\n    ASCII codes.\\n\\n    Examples:\\n        digitSum(\\\"\\\") => 0\\n        digitSum(\\\"abAB\\\") => 131\\n        digitSum(\\\"abcCd\\\") => 67\\n        digitSum(\\\"helloE\\\") => 69\\n        digitSum(\\\"woArBld\\\") => 131\\n        digitSum(\\\"aAaaaXa\\\") => 153\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
