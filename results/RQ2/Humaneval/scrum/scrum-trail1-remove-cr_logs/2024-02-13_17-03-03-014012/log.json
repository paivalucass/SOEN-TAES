For example, for 'Lists with different numbers of strings' test case, we can add a boundary test case with only one string in each list. This will help in covering edge cases and ensuring robustness of the code.\\\",\\n  \\\"Developer\\\": \\\"As a Developer, I suggest revising the test cases by including negative test cases to test the error handling of the code. For example, for 'Lists with non-numeric strings' test case, we can include a negative test case with non-string input data to check if the code handles such scenarios appropriately.\\\"\\n}\\n # Draft Test cases:\\n{\\n  \\\"test_cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Empty lists\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=[], parameter2=[]\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"[]\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Lists with different numbers of strings\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=['hi', 'admin'], parameter2=['hI', 'Hi']\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"['hI', 'Hi']\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Lists with the same number of characters\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=['hi', 'admin'], parameter2=['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"['hi', 'admin']\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Lists with the same number of characters but different strings\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=['hi', 'admin'], parameter2=['hI', 'hi', 'hi']\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"['hI', 'hi', 'hi']\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Lists with non-numeric strings\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"parameter1=['4'], parameter2=['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"['4']\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction.
