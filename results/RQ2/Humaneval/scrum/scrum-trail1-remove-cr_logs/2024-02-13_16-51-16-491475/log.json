The elements at index 0 are 5 and 2, which causes the lists to differ.\n\nBased on the analysis of the test script's output, it is evident that the code has failed the test for the sort_third function.\n\nCode Test Result: FAIL\n\nInput and Expected Output Example:\nInput: [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]\nExpected Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n\nThe code has failed to produce the expected output for the given input, as evidenced by the test script's output.\n\nConclusion: Code Test Failed# suggestions:\n{\"product-owner\": [\"I believe we should prioritize fixing the sort_third function as it seems to be a critical issue impacting the test results.\"], \"architect\": [\"It is important to review the code for the sort_third function and identify the root cause of the failure before making any changes.\"], \"developer\": [\"We need to review the sort_third function and check for any errors in the code that could be causing the test to fail.\"], \"tester\": [\"There may be an issue with the sort_third function in the code.
