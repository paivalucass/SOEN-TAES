Each cell of the grid contains a unique positive integer value in the range [1, N * N].\\n2. k: a positive integer representing the length of the minimum path to be found.\\n\\nThe function will return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path goes through.\\n\\nTo address the developer's suggestion, I will implement a graph data structure to represent the grid and utilize the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find all possible paths of length k. Additionally, I will handle edge cases such as invalid input for grid or k.\\n\\nTo address the tester's suggestion, I will create test cases to cover various scenarios such as different grid sizes, different values for k, and edge cases like an empty grid or k equal to 1. It's important to ensure that the function returns the correct ordered list of values for the minimum path and handles any potential errors gracefully.\\n\\nThe high-level algorithm for finding the minimum path of length k in the grid is as follows:\\n1. Create a graph representing the grid where each cell is a node and edges exist between adjacent cells.\\n2. Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find all possible paths of length k in the grid.\\n3. Store the values of the cells for each path and compare them to find the lexicographically minimum path.\\n4. Return the values of the cells for the lexicographically minimum path as the output.\\n\\nThis design incorporates the suggestions and provides a clear approach for the developer to implement the minPath function, focusing on the algorithm and steps to be followed rather than specific implementation details.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef minPath(grid, k):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, \\n    each cell of the grid contains a value.
