The function_under_test is not defined in the code, leading to a NameError during the execution of the test case. This indicates a failure in the code.\n\nConclusion:\nCode Test Failed\n\nInput and Expected Output Example:\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\n    words = s.split(' ')\n    ordered_words = []\n    for word in words:\n        ordered_word = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        ordered_words.append(ordered_word)\n    return ' '.join(ordered_words)\n\nThe expected output for the above function is not provided, as the code failed the test.\n\nNote: The code needs to be reviewed and modified to address the NameError and ensure the function_under_test is properly defined for successful execution of the test cases.# suggestions:\n{\"product-owner\": [\"Prioritize the review and modification of the code to address the NameError and ensure the proper definition of the function_under_test for successful test execution\"], \"architect\": [\"Review and modify the code to properly define the function_under_test for successful execution of the test cases\", \"Lead the team in reviewing and modifying the code to properly define the function_under_test for successful execution of the test cases\"], \"developer\": [\"Review the code and define the function_under_test to address the NameError and ensure successful test execution\"], \"tester\": [\"Review the code to address the NameError and ensure that the function_under_test is properly defined for successful execution of the test cases\"]}",
        "Question": "The original code has some bugs, according to the test report and suggestions, rewrite the code. Complete the following code:\n\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.\n    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)\n    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in\n    ascending order based on ascii value.\n    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.\n\n    For example:\n    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'\n    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'\n    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'\n    \"\"\"\n"
