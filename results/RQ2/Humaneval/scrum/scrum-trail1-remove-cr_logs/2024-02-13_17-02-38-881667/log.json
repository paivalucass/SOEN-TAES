For example, instead of providing the input data as 'arr=[1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]', it would be clearer to specify the input array directly as 'arr=[1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]'. This will help in understanding and replicating the test cases more effectively. Additionally, it would be beneficial to have a separate test case for testing with a large input array and another for testing with negative numbers or duplicate numbers in the array.\\\"\\n}\\n # Draft Test cases:\\n{\\n  \\\"test_cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Valid Input Array\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=[1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"4\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Single Element Array\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=[3]\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"0\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Empty Input Array\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"arr=[]\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": \\\"0\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction.
