The function should validate the input to ensure that it is a non-negative integer and handle invalid input by providing appropriate error messages.\\n\\nThe function should use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for efficient prime number generation. The algorithm will be well-documented and clearly explained in the code to guide the developer in understanding and maintaining the implementation. Meaningful variable names and comments will be used to improve code readability.\\n\\nThe count_up_to function will be tested with various non-negative integer inputs, including edge cases such as 0 and 1. The testing will verify that the function returns the correct array of prime numbers less than n and that appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs. The user interface will be checked for clarity and helpful prompts or tooltips.\\n\\nThe function will have a clear and intuitive user interface, providing helpful prompts or tooltips to guide users in using the function. It will also include examples of input and output to demonstrate how the function should be used. Additionally, the function will include error handling to provide feedback when there are no prime numbers less than n.\\n\\nOverall, the design prioritizes user experience and ensures that the count_up_to function is easy to use and understand, while also focusing on efficient prime number generation.
