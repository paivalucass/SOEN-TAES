The function should return a boolean value indicating whether the second word or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word.\\n\\nTo achieve this functionality, the developer should consider implementing a string rotation algorithm such as the reversal algorithm or the concatenation algorithm to generate all possible rotations of the second word. This will allow for efficient checking if any of these rotations is a substring of the first word.\\n\\nPerformance and scalability should be a priority when implementing the rotation algorithm, as the size of the input words could potentially be large. It is essential to optimize the algorithm to handle such scenarios efficiently. Thorough testing with various input cases should also be conducted to ensure correctness and efficiency, including both small and large input words to assess performance and scalability of the implementation. Additionally, edge cases and boundary cases should be considered to validate the functionality of the function.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef cycpattern_check(a , b):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"You are given 2 words.
