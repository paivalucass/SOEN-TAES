The function should return a boolean value, True if the given lengths form a right-angled triangle, and False otherwise.\n\nThe best approach for implementing the right_angle_triangle function is to use the Pythagorean theorem to check if the given lengths satisfy the condition for a right-angled triangle. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nThe function should calculate the squares of the lengths of the given sides and then check if the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides is equal to the square of the longest side. If it is, the function should return True, indicating that the given lengths form a right-angled triangle. If not, the function should return False.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):\n    '''\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
