In response to the architect's suggestion, I have included the consideration of using a graph algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently find the minimum path of length k in the given grid. This algorithm will help in finding the shortest path from any cell to its neighbor cells and obtain the ordered list of values on the cells that the minimum path goes through. Additionally, in line with the tester's recommendation, I have included the need for thorough testing for different grid sizes and varying lengths of k to ensure the algorithm accurately finds the minimum path.
