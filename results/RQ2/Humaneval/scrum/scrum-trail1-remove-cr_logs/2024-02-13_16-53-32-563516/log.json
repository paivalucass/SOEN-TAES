The algorithm will optimize the joining of groups to form the encoded string. If a group has fewer than three characters, there will be no cycling. This function will be designed to be efficient and scalable, considering the efficiency and performance of the encoding process.\\n\\nThe `decode_cyclic` function will take as input a string that has been encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function and efficiently reverse the process of encoding by undoing the cycling of groups of three characters. This function will be designed to handle edge cases and input validations effectively and efficiently reverse the encoding process.\\n\\nBoth functions will have comprehensive test cases to cover various scenarios, including input strings of different lengths, special characters, and edge cases such as empty input. The performance and efficiency of the encoding and decoding processes will be tested with large input strings to ensure scalability. Additionally, error handling and edge case scenarios will be thoroughly tested to validate the robustness of the solution.\\n\\nOverall, the design will prioritize clarity, maintainability, and reusability of the code, as well as providing clear documentation for developers to understand and implement the solution effectively.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef encode_cyclic(s: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    # split string to groups.
