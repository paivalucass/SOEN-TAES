Iterate through the input list of integers.\n2. Calculate the sum of digits for each integer.\n3. Create a new list of tuples where each tuple contains the original integer and its sum of digits.\n4. Sort the list of tuples based on the sum of digits, and if there are ties, based on the index of the integer in the original list.\n5.
