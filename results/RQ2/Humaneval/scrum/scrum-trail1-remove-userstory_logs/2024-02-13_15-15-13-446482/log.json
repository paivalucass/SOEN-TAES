    "DesignDraft0": "Design:\n\nTo accommodate potential future changes or requirements, it is recommended to use a modular and extensible approach in designing the encryption function.\n\nOne possible design approach is to create a modular encryption module that encapsulates the logic for rotating the alphabet and encrypting the input string. This module can expose a function, such as `rotateAlphabet`, that takes a rotation value as a parameter and returns the rotated alphabet. Additionally, the module can expose an `encrypt` function that takes a string and a rotation value as parameters, and returns the encrypted string.\n\nBy using a modular approach, the encryption function can be easily extended to accommodate future changes, such as different rotation algorithms or additional encryption methods. This design also promotes code reusability and maintainability, as the encryption logic is encapsulated within a separate module.",
