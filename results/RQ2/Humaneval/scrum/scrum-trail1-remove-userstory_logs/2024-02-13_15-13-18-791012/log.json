The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.\n    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.\n    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write \n    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:\n             GPA       |    Letter grade\n              4.0                A+\n            > 3.7                A \n            > 3.3                A- \n            > 3.0                B+\n            > 2.7                B \n            > 2.3                B-\n            > 2.0                C+\n            > 1.7                C\n            > 1.3                C-\n            > 1.0                D+ \n            > 0.7                D \n            > 0.0                D-\n              0.0                E\n    \n\n    Example:\n    grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']\n    \"\"\"\n"
