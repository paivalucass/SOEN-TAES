Analyze the requirements for the task:\n   - The task is to create a function called double_the_difference that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of squares of the numbers in the list that are odd.\n   - The function should ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.\n   - If the input list is empty, the function should return 0.\n\n2. Design a solution to efficiently calculate the sum of squares of odd numbers:\n   - Create a function called double_the_difference that takes a list of numbers as input.\n   - Initialize a variable to store the sum of squares of odd numbers.\n   - Iterate through the input list and for each number, check if it is odd and not negative.\n   - If the number is odd and not negative, square it and add it to the sum variable.\n   - Finally, return the sum variable as the result.\n\nBy following this design, the developer can efficiently implement the double_the_difference function to calculate the sum of squares of odd numbers in the input list.
