The function 'function_under_test' is not defined, which caused the test to fail.\n\nInput and Expected Output Example:\ndef solve(s):\n    result = ''\n    has_letters = False\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            has_letters = True\n            if char.islower():\n                result += char.upper()\n            else:\n                result += char.lower()\n        else:\n            result += char\n    if not has_letters:\n        result = result[::-1]\n    return result\n\nCode Test Failed# suggestions:\n{\"product-owner\": [\"We should prioritize fixing the NameError in the function_under_test before proceeding with any further development.\"], \"architect\": [\"It is crucial to review the code and ensure that the function_under_test is properly defined before running the test script.\"], \"developer\": [\"We need to define the function 'function_under_test' before running the test script.\"], \"tester\": [\"Check the function_under_test to ensure it is properly defined and accessible within the test script.\"]}",
        "Question": "The original code has some bugs, according to the test report and suggestions, rewrite the code. Complete the following code:\n\ndef solve(s):\n    \"\"\"You are given a string s.\n    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, \n    otherwise keep it as it is.\n    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.\n    The function should return the resulted string.\n    Examples\n    solve(\"1234\") = \"4321\"\n    solve(\"ab\") = \"AB\"\n    solve(\"#a@C\") = \"#A@c\"\n    \"\"\"\n"
