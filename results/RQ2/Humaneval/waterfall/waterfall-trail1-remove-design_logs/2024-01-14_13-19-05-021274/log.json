    "TestReport2": "Test Report:\n\nAfter analyzing the test script's output, it is evident that the code has failed the test. The specific failure occurred in the test method within the main Test class. The assertion error indicates that the expected output [0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 8] does not match the actual output [0, 1, 1, 2]. The lists differ at element 3 and the second list contains two additional elements compared to the first list.\n\nGiven this failure, it is necessary to investigate the code and make appropriate modifications to ensure that it produces the expected output. The input and expected output example should be reviewed to identify the source of the discrepancy and address it accordingly.\n\nConclusion: Code Test Failed. Further investigation and debugging are required to rectify the discrepancies in the code.\n\n[Input Example]\nInput: tri(3)\nExpected Output: [0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 8]",
