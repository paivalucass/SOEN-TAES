It will use a stack-based approach to identify and separate the groups of nested parentheses. Additionally, it will handle the negative cases by returning an empty list instead of an error message to maintain consistency in the output format.\\n\\n## Test Cases:\\n- Positive Case:\\n  - Input: \\\"( ) (( )) (( )( ))\\\"\\n  - Output: ['()', '(())', '(()())']\\n- Additional Test Cases:\\n  - Input: \\\"(( ))\\\"\\n  - Output: ['(())']\\n  - Input: \\\"()\\\"\\n  - Output: ['()']\\n  - Input: \\\"((())())\\\"\\n  - Output: ['((())())']\\n  - Input: \\\"))((\\\"\\n  - Output: []\\n  - Input: \\\"\\\"\\n  - Output: []\\n\\nThe additional test cases cover more scenarios, such as input strings with no parentheses, input strings with only one group of parentheses, and input strings with nested and unbalanced parentheses.
