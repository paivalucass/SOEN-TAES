It should also be able to count and report the number of collisions.\\n\\nHigh-level Design:\\n\\n1. Input: The system should take the number of cars on the road as input.\\n2. Approach: The system will use a tracking algorithm to monitor the movement of cars in opposite directions. It will use a collision detection algorithm to detect collisions between cars moving left to right and right to left.\\n3. Output: The system should provide the output indicating the number of collisions.\\n\\nCode Design:\\n\\nThe car_race_collision function takes an integer n as input and returns the number of collisions between cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road.\\n\\n```python\\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\\n    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\\n    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from\\n    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\\n    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.\\n    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\\n    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.\\n\\n    This function outputs the number of such collisions.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis design provides additional details about the approach to tracking the movement of cars and detecting collisions, as suggested by the developer. It also includes a section for defining test cases to ensure all scenarios are covered during testing, addressing the suggestion from the tester.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\\n    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\\n    are driving right to left.
