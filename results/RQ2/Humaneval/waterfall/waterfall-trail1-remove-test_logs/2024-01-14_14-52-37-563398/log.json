It should split the input by characters instead of by words, and the count_dict should be updated with the count of each letter. Also, the conditional check for islower() may not work as expected. It would be better to use a different approach to count the letters.\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"Tester\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"The code seems to have a logical flaw.
