First, it would be good to add more input validation to handle edge cases such as empty strings or non-numeric input. Additionally, the function could be made more readable by using clearer variable names and adding comments to explain the rounding logic.\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"Tester\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"As a tester, I would suggest adding more test cases to cover a wider range of input values, including edge cases such as empty strings, non-numeric input, and values equidistant from two integers. Additionally, it would be good to test the performance of the function with large input values to ensure it runs efficiently.\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\"\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction section.
