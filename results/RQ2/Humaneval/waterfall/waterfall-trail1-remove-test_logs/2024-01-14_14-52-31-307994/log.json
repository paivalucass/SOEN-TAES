It would be better to optimize the algorithm by finding a more efficient way to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"Tester\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"The code should be tested with different input arrays, including edge cases such as empty arrays, arrays with unique elements, and arrays with non-unique elements. Additionally, the performance of the code should be measured for large input arrays to ensure efficiency.\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\"\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction section.
