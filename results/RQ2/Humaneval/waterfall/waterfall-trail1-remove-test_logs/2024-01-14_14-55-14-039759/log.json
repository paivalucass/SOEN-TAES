For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a \\n    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not \\n    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. \\n    \\n    Examples:\\n    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6\\n    For lst = []  the output should be 0\\n    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    if not isinstance(lst, list):\\n        raise TypeError(\\\"Input must be a list of integers\\\")\\n    \\n    if not all(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst):\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Input list must contain only integers\\\")\\n    \\n    if len(lst) > 100000:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Input list must not exceed 100,000 entries\\\")\\n    \\n    total_sum = 0\\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\\n        if i % 3 == 0:\\n            lst[i] **= 2\\n        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:\\n            lst[i] **= 3\\n        \\n        total_sum += lst[i]\\n        \\n    return total_sum\\n\\n# Advices:\\n\\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"Architect\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"The function should be broken down into smaller, more modular functions for better readability and maintainability. Also, the conditional logic for squaring and cubing the integers can be simplified using a single conditional statement.\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"Tester\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Test cases should include edge cases such as an empty input list, a list with only one element, and a list with the maximum allowed entries (100,000).
