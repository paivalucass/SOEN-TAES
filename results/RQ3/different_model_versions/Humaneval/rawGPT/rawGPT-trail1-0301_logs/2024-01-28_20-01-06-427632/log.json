    "FinalCode": "The function add_elements takes in two parameters: an array of integers arr and an integer k. The function returns the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr. \n\nFor example, if arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9] and k = 4, the function should return 24, which is the sum of 21 and 3. Note that the elements with more than two digits, such as 111 and 4000, are not included in the sum. \n\nThe function has two constraints: the length of arr must be between 1 and 100, and k must be between 1 and the length of arr."
