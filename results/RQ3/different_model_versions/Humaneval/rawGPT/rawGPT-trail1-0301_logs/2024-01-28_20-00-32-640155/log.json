    "FinalCode": "This is a Python function definition for removing duplicates from a list of integers. The function takes in a list of integers as an argument and returns a new list with all duplicate elements removed, while maintaining the original order of the elements in the input list. \n\nThe function definition includes type hints, which indicate that the input argument must be a List of integers and the return type must also be a List of integers.\n\nThe function body itself is not provided in this code snippet, but a doctest is included to show an example usage of the function. The doctest provides an example input list and the expected output of the function."
