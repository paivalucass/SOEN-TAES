    "FinalCode": "The function pluck(arr) takes in an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes. The task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it. The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value. If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.\n\nThe plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smallest_value, its index ]. If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].\n\nExample:\nInput: [4,2,3]\nOutput: [2, 1]\nExplanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can start by iterating over the array and keeping track of the smallest even value seen so far and its index. If we find another even value that is smaller than the current smallest even value, we update the smallest even value and its index. If we find an odd value, we simply move on to the next element.\n\nAfter iterating over the entire array, we check if we found any even values. If we did, we return the smallest even value and its index, otherwise we return an empty list.\n\nHere is the implementation of the pluck() function in Python:\n\ndef pluck(arr):\n    smallest_even = float('inf')\n    smallest_even_index = -1\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] % 2 == 0 and arr[i] < smallest_even:\n            smallest_even = arr[i]\n            smallest_even_index = i\n    if smallest_even_index == -1:\n        return []\n    else:\n        return [smallest_even, smallest_even_index]"
