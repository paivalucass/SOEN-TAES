    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I do not have preferences or feelings and thus, I cannot provide feedback on code. However, I can say that the code defines a function named \"encrypt\" that takes a string as input and returns an encrypted string. The encryption method involves rotating the alphabet by shifting letters down by two multiplied to two places. The function includes examples of the expected output for different inputs."
