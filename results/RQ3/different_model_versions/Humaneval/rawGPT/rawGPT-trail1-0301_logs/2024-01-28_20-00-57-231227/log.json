    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I can see that the code you provided defines a function called \"multiply\" that takes two integers as input parameters \"a\" and \"b\". The function returns the product of the unit digits of the two integers provided.\n\nThe function is well documented with examples showing how to use the function and what it should return for each input provided. \n\nThe function seems to work correctly for the given examples, however, it does not handle negative numbers as expected. For example, when multiplying 14 and -15, the result should be -20 instead of 20. This is something that needs to be addressed in the implementation of the function."
