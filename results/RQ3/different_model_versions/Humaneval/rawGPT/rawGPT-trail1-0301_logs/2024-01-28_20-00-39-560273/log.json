    "FinalCode": "To efficiently compute the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence, we can use dynamic programming. We will create an array of size n+1 to store the values of the sequence up to the n-th element.\n\nWe can initialize the first four elements of the array to the values 0, 0, 2, and 0. Then, we can use a loop to iterate from 4 to n and calculate each subsequent element of the sequence by summing the previous four elements in the array.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\ndef fib4(n: int):\n    if n < 4:\n        return [0, 0, 2, 0][n]\n    fib = [0] * (n+1)\n    fib[2] = 2\n    for i in range(3, n+1):\n        fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2] + fib[i-3] + fib[i-4]\n    return fib[n]\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), as we iterate through the loop n-4 times to calculate the n-th element."
