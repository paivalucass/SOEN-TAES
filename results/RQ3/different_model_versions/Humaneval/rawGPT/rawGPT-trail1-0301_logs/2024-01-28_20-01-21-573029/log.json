    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I can see that the code provided is a function definition in Python that takes a positive integer as input and returns its Roman numeral equivalent in lowercase as a string. The function is named \"int_to_mini_roman\" and it has a docstring that provides a brief description of the function along with some examples.\n\nThe function implementation is not provided in the code snippet, so it is not possible to see how the Roman numerals are calculated. However, based on the docstring, it is clear that the function is limited to handling integers between 1 and 1000.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be a good starting point for implementing a function that converts an integer to a Roman numeral in lowercase."
