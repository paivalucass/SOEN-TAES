    "FinalCode": "The function `intersperse` takes in two parameters: `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and `delimiter`, which is also an integer. The function returns a new list where the `delimiter` is inserted between every two consecutive elements of the input list `numbers`. \n\nThe function definition includes a type hint for the input parameter `numbers`, which indicates that it is a List of integers. The return type of the function is also annotated as a List of integers. \n\nThe docstring of the function provides examples of expected behavior for the function, including an empty input list and a non-empty input list. \n\nNote that this code snippet only includes the function definition and its docstring, and does not include any code to call or test the function."
