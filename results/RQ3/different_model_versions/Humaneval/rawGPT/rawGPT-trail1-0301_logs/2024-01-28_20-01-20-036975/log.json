    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I cannot explain the code functionality through an example or text. However, I can explain the code logic. \n\nThe code defines a function named \"compare\" that takes two arrays as input, game, and guess. The function mainly compares the guessed scores with actual scores and returns the difference between them. \n\nThe function iterates through the elements of both arrays and compares them. If the guessed score matches the actual score, the difference is zero, and if not, the absolute difference between the guessed score and actual score is calculated and stored in a new array. \n\nFinally, the function returns the array containing the differences between the guessed scores and actual scores."
