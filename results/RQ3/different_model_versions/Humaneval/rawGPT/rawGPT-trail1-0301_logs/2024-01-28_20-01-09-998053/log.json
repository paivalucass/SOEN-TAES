    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I can understand that this is a Python function definition for a Tribonacci sequence. The function tri(n) takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns a list of the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The sequence is defined as follows:\n\n- tri(1) = 3\n- tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.\n- tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.\n\nThe code also provides some examples to help understand how the function works. For example, tri(3) should return [1, 3, 2, 8] as the first four numbers of the Tribonacci sequence."
