    "FinalCode": "The code defines a function called \"get_row\" that takes two arguments - a nested list called \"lst\" and an integer called \"x\". The function searches for all occurrences of the integer \"x\" in the list and returns a list of tuples representing the coordinates of each occurrence.\n\nThe function first checks if the list \"lst\" is empty and returns an empty list if it is. It then iterates through each row of the list, using a nested loop to iterate through each element in the row. If the element is equal to \"x\", the function creates a tuple representing the coordinates of the element, adds it to a list called \"coordinates\", and moves on to the next element.\n\nOnce all elements have been searched, the function sorts the list of coordinates by row in ascending order using the built-in \"sorted\" function with a lambda function to sort by the first element of each tuple. It then sorts the coordinates within each row by column in descending order using a lambda function to sort by the second element of each tuple.\n\nFinally, the function returns the sorted list of coordinates."
