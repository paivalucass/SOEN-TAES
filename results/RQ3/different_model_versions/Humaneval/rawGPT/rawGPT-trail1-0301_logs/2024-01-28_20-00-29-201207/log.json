    "FinalCode": "The function takes in a string representing musical notes and returns a list of integers corresponding to how many beats each note lasts. The special ASCII format is as follows: 'o' represents a whole note which lasts four beats, 'o|' represents a half note which lasts two beats, and '.|' represents a quarter note which lasts one beat. The function uses the legend to parse the input string and returns a list of integers representing how long each note lasts. The example input and output provided are used to illustrate how the function works."
