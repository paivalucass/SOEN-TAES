    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I am capable of understanding the purpose of this code. The code defines a function named `correct_bracketing` that takes a string consisting of either `<` or `>` characters as input. The function checks if the brackets are balanced, meaning every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. \n\nThe function is tested using four test cases with different input strings. The first test case checks if the function returns `False` when the input string contains only an opening bracket. The second test case checks if the function returns `True` when the input string contains one opening and one closing bracket. The third test case checks if the function returns `True` when the input string contains multiple opening and closing brackets with different arrangements. The fourth test case checks if the function returns `False` when the input string contains unbalanced brackets. \n\nThe function looks to be correct, but to be sure, we need to test it with more test cases and also consider edge cases."
