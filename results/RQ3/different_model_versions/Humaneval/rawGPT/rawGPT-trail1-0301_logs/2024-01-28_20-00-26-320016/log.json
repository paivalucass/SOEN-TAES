    "FinalCode": "The above code defines a function called \"rolling_max\" that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of rolling maximum elements found until a given moment in the sequence. The function uses the \"typing\" module to specify the type of input and output. \n\nHere's how the function works: \n\n- It takes in a list of integers called \"numbers\". \n- It then generates a new list called \"rolling_max_numbers\" that has the same length as \"numbers\". \n- It initializes the first element of \"rolling_max_numbers\" to be the first element of \"numbers\". \n- It then iterates through the rest of the elements in \"numbers\". \n- For each element in \"numbers\", it checks if it is greater than the previous element. If it is, then it sets the corresponding element in \"rolling_max_numbers\" to be the current element. If it is not, then it sets the corresponding element in \"rolling_max_numbers\" to be the same as the previous element. \n- Finally, it returns the \"rolling_max_numbers\" list. \n\nFor example, if we call the function with the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2], the function will return [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]. \n\nThis is because: \n\n- The first element of \"rolling_max_numbers\" is set to be the first element of \"numbers\", which is 1. \n- The second element of \"rolling_max_numbers\" is set to be the maximum of the first two elements of \"numbers\", which is 2. \n- The third element of \"rolling_max_numbers\" is set to be the maximum of the first three elements of \"numbers\", which is 3. \n- The fourth element of \"rolling_max_numbers\" is set to be the maximum of the second, third, and fourth elements of \"numbers\", which is 3. \n- The fifth element of \"rolling_max_numbers\" is set to be the maximum of the third, fourth, and fifth elements of \"numbers\", which is also 3. \n- The sixth element of \"rolling_max_numbers\" is set to be the maximum of the fourth, fifth, and sixth elements of \"numbers\", which is 4. \n- The seventh element of \"rolling_max_numbers\" is set to be the maximum of the fifth, sixth, and seventh elements of \"numbers\", which is also 4."
