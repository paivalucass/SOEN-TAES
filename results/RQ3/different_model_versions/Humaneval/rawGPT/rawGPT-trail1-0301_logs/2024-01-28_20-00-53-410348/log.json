    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I cannot execute Python code. However, I can help you understand what this code is doing. \n\nThe code defines a function named `add` that takes a list of integers `lst` as input. The function's purpose is to add the even numbers in `lst` that are at odd indices (meaning the element is at an odd index in the list, starting from 0).\n\nFor example, in the list `[4, 2, 6, 7]`, the even numbers at odd indices are `2` and `7`, since `2` is at index `1` and `7` is at index `3`. The function should return the sum of these even numbers, which is `2 + 7 = 9`.\n\nThe function does not modify the original list `lst`. It simply returns the sum of the even numbers at odd indices in the list."
