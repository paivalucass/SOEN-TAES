    "FinalCode": "The above code defines a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers and returns a tuple consisting of the sum and the product of all the integers in the list.\n\nThe function uses the `typing` module to specify the input and output types. The input is a list of integers and the output is a tuple containing two integers.\n\nThe function uses a for loop to iterate over the list of integers and calculate the sum and product. If the list is empty, the sum is 0 and the product is 1.\n\nThe function returns the sum and product as a tuple using the `Tuple` type annotation from the `typing` module. The function also includes a docstring that explains what the function does and provides examples of how to use it."
