    "FinalCode": "The given function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the digits of the largest prime number in the list. \n\nTo solve the problem, the function first initializes a variable \"max_prime\" to None. It then iterates through the list and checks if each number is prime. If a prime number is found, it is compared with the current value of \"max_prime\" and if it is greater, it is assigned to \"max_prime\". \n\nOnce the iteration is complete, the function checks if \"max_prime\" is None. If it is, it means that no prime number was found in the list and the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function converts \"max_prime\" to a string and calculates the sum of its digits using a loop.\n\nHere is the implementation of the function:\n\ndef largest_prime_sum(lst):\n    max_prime = None\n    for num in lst:\n        if num > 1:\n            for i in range(2, num):\n                if (num % i) == 0:\n                    break\n            else:\n                if max_prime is None or num > max_prime:\n                    max_prime = num\n                    \n    if max_prime is None:\n        return 0\n    \n    prime_str = str(max_prime)\n    digit_sum = 0\n    for digit in prime_str:\n        digit_sum += int(digit)\n    \n    return digit_sum"
