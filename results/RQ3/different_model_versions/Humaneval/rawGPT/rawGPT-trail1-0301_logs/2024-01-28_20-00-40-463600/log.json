    "FinalCode": "This is a Python function named modp that takes two integer arguments, n and p. The purpose of the function is to return the value of 2^n modulo p. The function includes a docstring that provides examples of how to use the function and what it should return for different input values.\n\nThe first example shows that modp(3,5) should return 3, which means that 2^3 mod 5 is equal to 3. The second example shows that modp(1101,101) should return 2, which means that 2^1101 mod 101 is equal to 2. The third example shows that modp(0,101) should return 1, which means that 2^0 mod 101 is equal to 1. The fourth example shows that modp(3,11) should return 8, which means that 2^3 mod 11 is equal to 8. The fifth example shows that modp(100,101) should return 1, which means that 2^100 mod 101 is equal to 1."
