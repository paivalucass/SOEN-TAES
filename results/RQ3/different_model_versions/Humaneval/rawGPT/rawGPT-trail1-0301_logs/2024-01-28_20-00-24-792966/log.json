    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I can explain what this Python code is doing.\n\nThe code defines a function called `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string input `paren_string` and returns a list of integers. The input string represents multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces.\n\nThe goal of the function is to determine the maximum level of nesting for each group of parentheses and return those values as a list of integers. For instance, the string `(()()) ((())) () ((())()())` has four groups of parentheses. The first group has a maximum nesting level of 2, the second has a level of 3, the third has a level of 1, and the fourth has a level of 3. Therefore, the function should return a list of `[2, 3, 1, 3]`.\n\nTo achieve this, the function begins by importing the `List` class from the `typing` module, which is used to define the return type of the function. Then, the function definition includes a docstring that explains the purpose of the function and provides an example of the expected output.\n\nInside the function, the first step is to split the input string into a list of individual groups of parentheses using the `split()` method. Then, a loop is used to iterate over each group and determine its maximum nesting level. This is done by counting the number of opening and closing parentheses in the group and subtracting them to find the difference in levels.\n\nThe maximum nesting level for each group is stored as an integer in a list called `nesting_levels`. Finally, the function returns the `nesting_levels` list as the output of the function."
