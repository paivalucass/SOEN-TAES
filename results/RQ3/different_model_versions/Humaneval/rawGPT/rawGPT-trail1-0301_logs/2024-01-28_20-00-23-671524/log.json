    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I cannot execute Python code, but I can explain what the code does. \n\nThe code defines a function named `truncate_number` that takes a floating-point number as its argument and returns the decimal part of the number. The function first explains in its docstring that a positive floating-point number can be divided into an integer part (largest integer smaller than the given number) and a decimal part (the leftover part always smaller than 1). \n\nThen the function returns only the decimal part of the number by subtracting its integer part from the original number. For example, if the number is 3.5, then the integer part is 3 and the decimal part is 0.5. The function returns the decimal part 0.5. \n\nThe function does not work with negative numbers."
