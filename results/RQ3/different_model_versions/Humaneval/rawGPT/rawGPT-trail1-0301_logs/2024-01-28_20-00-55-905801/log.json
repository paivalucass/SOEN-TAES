    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I can explain the given code in simple terms. \n\nThe code defines a function called `is_bored()` which takes a string as input. The purpose of the function is to count the number of sentences that start with the word \"I\" in the given string.\n\nThe function first splits the string into sentences using the delimiters '.', '?' or '!' by using the `split()` method. Then, it iterates over each sentence and checks if it starts with the word \"I\" using the `startswith()` method.\n\nIf the sentence starts with \"I\", it increments a counter. Finally, the function returns the count of boredoms (number of sentences starting with \"I\").\n\nThe function can be used to check if a given string contains any sentences starting with \"I\"."
