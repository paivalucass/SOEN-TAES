    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I cannot test the code and verify if there is any syntax error. However, I can explain the code logic and functionality.\n\nThe code defines a function called `words_string` with a single parameter `s`, which is a string of words separated by commas or spaces. The function's task is to split the string into individual words and return an array of those words.\n\nThe function uses a docstring to describe its functionality, which states that it should split the string into words, create an array of those words, and return it.\n\nThe function first replaces all commas with spaces in the string to make it easier to split the words. Then it uses the `split()` method to split the string into individual words based on spaces. Finally, it returns an array of those words using the `list()` constructor.\n\nOverall, the function seems to be functioning correctly and should work as intended."
