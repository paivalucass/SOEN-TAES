    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I cannot execute the code, but I can explain what this function does.\n\nThe function `move_one_ball` takes an array `arr` of integers as input and checks if it is possible to obtain a sorted array in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations on the given array.\n\nThe right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index.\n\nThe function returns True if it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation, else it returns False. If the given array is empty, the function returns True.\n\nThe function first checks if the array is empty. If it is not empty, it then iterates over the array and checks if the current element is greater than the next element. If it is, it sets a flag `found` to True and breaks out of the loop.\n\nIf the flag is True, it then checks if the first element of the array is greater than or equal to the last element of the array. If it is, it returns True, else it returns False.\n\nIf the flag is False, it means that the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order and the function returns True."
