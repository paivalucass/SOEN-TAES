    "FinalCode": "The code defines two functions: \"poly\" and \"find_zero\"\n\nThe \"poly\" function takes in two arguments: a list of coefficients \"xs\" and a value to evaluate the polynomial at \"x\". It then uses a list comprehension to calculate each term of the polynomial using the \"math.pow\" function and then sums these terms to get the final result.\n\nThe \"find_zero\" function takes in a list of coefficients \"xs\". It first checks that the length of \"xs\" is even and that the largest non-zero coefficient is not zero. It then uses the \"poly\" function to evaluate the polynomial at various values of \"x\" until it finds a value where the result is very close to zero (within a certain tolerance). It returns this value as the zero point.\n\nThe code also includes two doctests to demonstrate how to use the \"find_zero\" function. The first doctest shows how to find the zero point of a linear polynomial and the second doctest shows how to find the zero point of a polynomial of degree 3."
