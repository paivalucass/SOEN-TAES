    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I am unable to execute this code as it is incomplete and lacks proper indentation. However, based on the code snippet provided, it appears to be a function named \"median\" that takes a list as an argument and calculates the median value of the elements in that list. The function includes two doctest examples that demonstrate how the function should be used and what values it should return when given specific input lists."
