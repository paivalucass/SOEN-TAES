    "FinalCode": "This is a function named `triangle_area` that takes in three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. The function checks if these three sides form a valid triangle by ensuring that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. \n\nIf the three sides form a valid triangle, the function calculates the area of the triangle and returns it rounded to 2 decimal places. If the three sides do not form a valid triangle, the function returns -1.\n\nThe function contains a docstring that explains what the function does and provides examples of how to use it.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n>>> triangle_area(3, 4, 5)\n6.0\n>>> triangle_area(1, 2, 10)\n-1\n```"
