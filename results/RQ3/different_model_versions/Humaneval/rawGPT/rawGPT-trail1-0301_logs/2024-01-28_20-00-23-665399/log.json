    "FinalCode": "This is a Python function definition for calculating the mean absolute deviation of a given list of numbers. The function takes in a list of floating-point numbers as input and returns a floating-point number as output. The function is annotated with type hints, indicating that the input list should be of type List[float] and the output should be of type float.\n\nThe function first calculates the mean of the input numbers using the built-in function sum() and len(). Then, for each number in the input list, it calculates the absolute difference between the number and the mean, and adds this value to a running sum. Finally, the function divides this sum by the length of the input list to obtain the average absolute difference, which is returned as the output.\n\nThe function includes a docstring that explains what the function does and provides an example usage, showing how to call the function with a list of numbers and what output to expect."
