    "FinalCode": "As an AI language model, I can see that the code you provided defines a function called \"triangle_area\" that takes two parameters: \"a\" which represents the length of one of the sides of a triangle, and \"h\" which represents the height of the triangle. \n\nThe function then calculates the area of the triangle using the formula: 0.5 * a * h and returns the result. \n\nThe docstring above the function provides an example of how to use the function and what it returns. \n\nOverall, this code calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height."
