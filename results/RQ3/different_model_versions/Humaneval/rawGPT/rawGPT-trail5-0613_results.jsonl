Check if the character is an alphabet using the `isalpha()` function.\n4. If the character is lowercase, find its ASCII code using `ord(char)`, subtract 97 (the ASCII code of 'a'), add 4 (to shift down by two multiplied by two places), take the modulo 26 (to wrap around the alphabet), and add 97 to get the new character.\n5.

Convert the ASCII code back to a character using `chr()` and add it to the `encrypted_string`.\n7. If the character is not an alphabet, simply add it to the `encrypted_string`.\n8. Finally, return the `encrypted_string`.\n\nHere are a few examples of how the function works:\n\n- `encrypt('hi')` returns `'lm'`: 'h' is shifted down by 4 positions to get 'l', and 'i' is shifted down by 4 positions to get 'm'.\n- `encrypt('asdfghjkl')` returns `'ewhjklnop'`: Each alphabet is shifted down by 4 positions.\n- `encrypt('gf')` returns `'kj'`: 'g' is shifted down by 4 positions to get 'k', and 'f' is shifted down by 4 positions to get 'j'.\n- `encrypt('et')` returns `'ix'`: 'e' is shifted down by 4 positions to get 'i', and 't' is shifted down by 4 positions to get 'x'."}

It does this by comparing the elements of the `game` array (which represents the actual scores) with the elements of the `guess` array. \n\nThe function then returns an array of the same length as the input arrays, where each element represents how far off the guess was from the actual score. If the guess was correct, the value is 0.

The first four matches have correct guesses, so the corresponding values in the output array will be 0. The fifth match has a guess of 2, but the actual score is 5. So the difference between the guess and the score is 3. The sixth match has a guess of -2, but the actual score is 1. So the difference between the guess and the score is also 3.

So the difference between the guess and the score is 4. The third match has a guess of 1, and the actual score is 0. So the difference between the guess and the score is 1. The fourth and fifth matches have correct guesses, so the corresponding values in the output array will be 0. The sixth match has a guess of -2, but the actual score is 4.
