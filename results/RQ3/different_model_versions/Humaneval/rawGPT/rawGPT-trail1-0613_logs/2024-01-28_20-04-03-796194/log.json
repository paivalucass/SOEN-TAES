    "FinalCode": "The code provided defines two functions: `encode_shift` and `decode_shift`.\n\nThe `encode_shift` function takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character `ch` in `s`, and for each character, it calculates the new ASCII value by adding 5 to the current ASCII value. The modulo operator `% 26` is used to handle wrapping around the alphabet. Finally, it uses the `chr` function to convert the new ASCII value back to a character. The list of encoded characters is then joined together into a single string using the `join` method.\n\nThe `decode_shift` function takes a string `s` as input, which is assumed to be encoded using the `encode_shift` function. It returns the decoded string by reversing the encoding process. It subtracts 5 from the ASCII value of each character, applies the modulo operator `% 26`, and adds the ASCII value of 'a' to get the original ASCII value. The original ASCII values are then converted back to characters using the `chr` function, and the list of decoded characters is joined into a single string.\n\nOverall, these functions provide a basic implementation of a Caesar cipher with a fixed shift of 5."
