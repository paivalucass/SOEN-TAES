    "FinalCode": "The function rounded_avg(n, m) takes in two positive integers n and m. It computes the average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). The average is rounded to the nearest integer and converted to binary.\n\nIf n is greater than m, the function returns -1.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n- For n = 1 and m = 5, the average of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 3. The rounded average in binary is 0b11.\n\n- For n = 7 and m = 5, n is greater than m so the function returns -1.\n\n- For n = 10 and m = 20, the average of 10, 11, 12, ..., 19, and 20 is 15. The rounded average in binary is 0b1111.\n\n- For n = 20 and m = 33, the average of 20, 21, 22, ..., 32, and 33 is 26. The rounded average in binary is 0b11010."
