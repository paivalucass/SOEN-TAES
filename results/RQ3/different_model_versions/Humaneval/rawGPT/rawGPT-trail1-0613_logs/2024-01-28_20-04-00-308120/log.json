    "FinalCode": "The code defines a function called `car_race_collision` which takes an integer `n` as input. The function calculates the number of collisions that occur between cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road.\n\nThe function calculates the number of collisions by comparing the positions of the cars moving left to right with the positions of the cars moving right to left. If a car moving left to right has a position greater than or equal to a car moving right to left, it means a collision has occurred. The function counts the number of collisions and returns the result.\n\nNote: The code provided is a function definition and does not call the function or provide any example inputs or outputs."
