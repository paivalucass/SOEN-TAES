    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function called `bf(planet1, planet2)` which takes two planet names as input. The function is intended to return a tuple containing all the planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of `planet1` and the orbit of `planet2`, sorted by proximity to the sun.\n\nTo achieve this, the function should first check if `planet1` and `planet2` are valid planet names. If either of them is not a correct planet name, the function should return an empty tuple.\n\nIf both planet names are valid, the function should determine the planets between `planet1` and `planet2`. The planets in our solar system are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The planets between `planet1` and `planet2` are those whose orbits are located between them. \n\nFinally, the function should return a tuple containing all the planets between `planet1` and `planet2`, sorted by proximity to the sun.\n\nThe function should be implemented as follows:\n\n```python\ndef bf(planet1, planet2):\n    planets = [\"Mercury\", \"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\", \"Uranus\", \"Neptune\"]\n    \n    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:\n        return ()\n    \n    index1 = planets.index(planet1)\n    index2 = planets.index(planet2)\n    \n    if index1 > index2:\n        index1, index2 = index2, index1\n    \n    return tuple(planets[index1+1:index2])\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nprint(bf(\"Jupiter\", \"Neptune\"))  # Output: (\"Saturn\", \"Uranus\")\nprint(bf(\"Earth\", \"Mercury\"))  # Output: (\"Venus\")\nprint(bf(\"Mercury\", \"Uranus\"))  # Output: (\"Venus\", \"Earth\", \"Mars\", \"Jupiter\", \"Saturn\")\n```"
