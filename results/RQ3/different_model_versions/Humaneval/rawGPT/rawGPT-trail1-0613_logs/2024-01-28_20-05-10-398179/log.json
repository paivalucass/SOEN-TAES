    "FinalCode": "Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        if i % 3 == 0:\n            sum += lst[i] ** 2\n        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:\n            sum += lst[i] ** 3\n    return sum\n```\n\nLet's go through the code step by step:\n\n- First, we initialize the variable `sum` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the sum of the squared and cubed entries.\n- Then, we iterate over the indices of the list using the `range(len(lst))` function.\n- Inside the loop, we check if the index `i` is a multiple of 3 using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, we square the corresponding entry `lst[i]` and add it to the sum.\n- Next, we check if the index `i` is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. If it is, we cube the corresponding entry `lst[i]` and add it to the sum.\n- Finally, after the loop is finished, we return the sum.\n\nThe code handles different scenarios, such as an empty list or negative numbers. It follows the provided examples to calculate the sum of squared and cubed entries correctly."
