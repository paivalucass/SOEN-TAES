    "FinalCode": "The code defines a function `solve` that takes an integer `N` as input and returns the total sum of its digits in binary. \n\nThe function starts with a docstring that provides an example and explains the input and output variables and their constraints.\n\nThe function implementation is missing. It should calculate the sum of the digits of `N` in binary representation. However, it is incomplete and needs to be added in order to solve the problem."
