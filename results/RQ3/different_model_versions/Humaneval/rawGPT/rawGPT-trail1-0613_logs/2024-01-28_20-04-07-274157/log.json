    "FinalCode": "The above code defines a function named `add` that takes in two integer arguments `x` and `y`. The function is used to add these two numbers together.\n\nThe function also includes a docstring, which is a multi-line string enclosed in triple quotes (`\"\"\"`). The purpose of the docstring is to provide a description of what the function does and document any expected inputs and outputs.\n\nIn this case, the docstring states that the `add` function is used to add two numbers `x` and `y`. It also includes some examples of how to use the function, along with the expected output for each example.\n\nFor example, according to the docstring, if we call `add(2, 3)`, it should return `5`, and if we call `add(5, 7)`, it should return `12`.\n\nThe `>>>` symbols before each example indicate that these are doctest examples. Doctests are a way to test the function by including them in the docstring itself. The doctest module can then be used to automatically run these tests and verify if the function behaves as expected.\n\nOverall, this code defines a function `add` that adds two numbers together and includes a docstring with examples to describe its usage and expected output."
