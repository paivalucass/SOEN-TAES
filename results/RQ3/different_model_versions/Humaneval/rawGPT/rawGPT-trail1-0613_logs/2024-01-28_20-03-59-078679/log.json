    "FinalCode": "The function `encode_cyclic` takes a string `s` as input and returns an encoded string by cyclically shifting groups of three characters.\n\nThe function first splits the input string `s` into groups of three characters each. This is done using list comprehension, where each element of the list is obtained by slicing the input string from index `(3 * i)` to `min((3 * i + 3), len(s))`. This ensures that the last group may have fewer than three characters if the length of the input string is not a multiple of three.\n\nNext, the function cycles the elements in each group, except for groups with fewer than three elements. This is done by creating a new list using list comprehension, where each element is obtained by concatenating the second and third characters of the group with the first character of the group. For groups with fewer than three elements, the group itself is used.\n\nFinally, the function joins the groups back together into a single string using the `join` method of empty string.\n\nThe function `decode_cyclic` takes as input a string encoded with the `encode_cyclic` function and returns the decoded string.\n\nNote: The function implementations are incomplete as the actual encoding and decoding logic is missing."
