    "FinalCode": "The function `sum_to_n` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`. The function has a docstring that provides examples of how the function should be used and what output to expect.\n\nHere is the code for the function:\n\n```python\ndef sum_to_n(n: int):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        total += i\n    return total\n```\n\nThe function uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to `n` and adds them to a running total (`total`). After looping through all the numbers, the function returns the final total.\n\nThe provided examples in the docstring demonstrate how the function works for different input values. For example, `sum_to_n(30)` returns 465 because the sum of numbers from 1 to 30 is 465. Similarly, `sum_to_n(100)` returns 5050 because the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 is 5050."
