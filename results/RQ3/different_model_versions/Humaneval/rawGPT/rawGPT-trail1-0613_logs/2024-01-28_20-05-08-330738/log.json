    "FinalCode": "The special_factorial function takes an integer, n, as input and returns the special factorial of that integer.\n\nThe special factorial is calculated by multiplying the factorial of each number from n to 1. \n\nFor example, if n is 4, the special factorial is calculated as:\n4! * 3! * 2! * 1! = 24 * 6 * 2 * 1 = 288\n\nTo implement this function, you can use a loop to iterate from n to 1 and calculate the factorial of each number. Then, multiply all the factorials together to get the special factorial."
