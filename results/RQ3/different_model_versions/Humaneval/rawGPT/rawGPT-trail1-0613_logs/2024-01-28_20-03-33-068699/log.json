    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function called `below_zero` that takes a list of integers called `operations` as input and returns a boolean value. \n\nThe function checks if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and if so, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.\n\nTo determine this, the function iterates over the `operations` list and keeps track of the current balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point, the function returns True. Otherwise, it continues iterating until the end of the list and returns False.\n\nThe function includes two examples of how to use it, with expected outputs."
