    "FinalCode": "The function `eat()` takes three parameters: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. It represents a hungry rabbit that has already eaten a certain number of carrots (`number`), but still needs to eat more carrots (`need`) to complete its meals. The function should return an array containing the total number of eaten carrots after the meals and the number of carrots left after the meals.\n\nIf there are not enough remaining carrots, the rabbit will eat all the remaining carrots but will still be hungry.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function should work:\n\n* `eat(5, 6, 10)` should return `[11, 4]` because the rabbit has already eaten 5 carrots, needs to eat 6 more, and there are 10 remaining carrots. After eating 6 more carrots, the rabbit will have eaten a total of 11 carrots and there will be 4 carrots left.\n\n* `eat(4, 8, 9)` should return `[12, 1]` because the rabbit has already eaten 4 carrots, needs to eat 8 more, and there are 9 remaining carrots. After eating all 9 remaining carrots, the rabbit will have eaten a total of 12 carrots and there will be 1 carrot left.\n\n* `eat(1, 10, 10)` should return `[11, 0]` because the rabbit has already eaten 1 carrot, needs to eat 10 more, and there are 10 remaining carrots. After eating all 10 remaining carrots, the rabbit will have eaten a total of 11 carrots and there will be no carrots left.\n\n* `eat(2, 11, 5)` should return `[7, 0]` because the rabbit has already eaten 2 carrots, needs to eat 11 more, and there are 5 remaining carrots. Since there are not enough remaining carrots, the rabbit will eat all the remaining 5 carrots and will still be hungry. Therefore, the total number of eaten carrots will be 7 and there will be no carrots left.\n\nThe function has the following variables:\n\n* `number` - an integer representing the number of carrots that the rabbit has already eaten.\n* `need` - an integer representing the number of carrots that the rabbit needs to eat.\n* `remaining` - an integer representing the number of remaining carrots in stock.\n\nThe function has the following constraints for the input variables:\n\n* `number` should be between 0 and 1000, inclusive.\n* `need` should be between 0 and 1000, inclusive.\n* `remaining` should be between 0 and 1000, inclusive.\n\nThe function is expected to return the result array as described above."
