    "FinalCode": "The function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'`. The new list `l'` is identical to the original list `l` in the indices that are not divisible by three, but the values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of `l`, but sorted.\n\nHere are a couple of examples of how the function works:\n\nExample 1:\n```python\nsort_third([1, 2, 3])\n```\nOutput:\n```\n[1, 2, 3]\n```\nExplanation: In this case, the input list `[1, 2, 3]` has no indices that are divisible by three, so the output list is the same as the input list.\n\nExample 2:\n```python\nsort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])\n```\nOutput:\n```\n[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]\n```\nExplanation: In this case, the input list `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]` has indices 0 and 6 that are divisible by three. The values at these indices are 5 and 2 respectively. The output list has the values at these indices sorted, so the final list becomes `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`.\n\nNote that the function `sort_third` is defined using type hints, which specify the types of the input and output variables. The input variable `l` is expected to be a list, and the function returns a list as output."
