    "FinalCode": "The function even_odd_palindrome(n) takes a positive integer n as input and returns a tuple that contains the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the range (1, n), inclusive.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can iterate through the range (1, n) and check if each number is a palindrome. If it is, we can check if it is even or odd and increment the corresponding counter.\n\nHere is the implementation of the even_odd_palindrome(n) function:\n\ndef even_odd_palindrome(n):\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n    \n    for num in range(1, n+1):\n        if str(num) == str(num)[::-1]:  # Check if the number is a palindrome\n            if num % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even\n                even_count += 1\n            else:\n                odd_count += 1\n    \n    return (even_count, odd_count)\n\nLet's test the function with the given examples:\n\nprint(even_odd_palindrome(3))  # Output: (1, 2)\nprint(even_odd_palindrome(12))  # Output: (4, 6)\n\nThe outputs are correct according to the examples provided."
