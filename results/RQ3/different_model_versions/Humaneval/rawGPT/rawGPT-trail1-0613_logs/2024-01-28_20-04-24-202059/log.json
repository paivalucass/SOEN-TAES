    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function called `hex_key` that takes in a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes.\n\nThe function uses the following logic to determine the count:\n\n1. Define a variable `count` and set it to 0.\n2. Iterate over each character in the input hexadecimal number.\n3. Check if the current character is '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B' (decimal 11), or 'D' (decimal 13).\n4. If the current character matches any of the prime digits, increment the `count` variable by 1.\n5. Return the final value of `count`.\n\nThe provided examples demonstrate how the function should work for different input cases."
