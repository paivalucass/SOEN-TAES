    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function named \"max_fill\" which takes in two parameters: \"grid\" and \"capacity\". \n\nThe function is supposed to find the minimum number of times the buckets need to be lowered in order to empty all the wells in the grid. The grid is represented as a 2D list, where each row represents a well and each 1 in a row represents a single unit of water. The capacity parameter represents the maximum number of units of water that can be extracted by a bucket at a time.\n\nThe function provides three examples with their expected outputs to demonstrate the usage and expected behavior of the function.\n\nThe function's implementation is missing and needs to be added."
