    "FinalCode": "One possible solution to this problem is to split the sentence into individual words using the `split()` method, and then iterate through each word to check if its length is a prime number. If it is, we append it to a new list. Finally, we join the words in the new list using the `join()` method and return the resulting string.\n\nHere is the implementation of the `words_in_sentence()` function:\n\n```\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\n    def is_prime(n):\n        if n <= 1:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    words = sentence.split()\n    prime_words = []\n    for word in words:\n        if is_prime(len(word)):\n            prime_words.append(word)\n\n    return ' '.join(prime_words)\n```\n\nWe can test the function with the provided examples:\n\n```\nprint(words_in_sentence(\"This is a test\"))  # Output: \"is\"\nprint(words_in_sentence(\"lets go for swimming\"))  # Output: \"go for\"\n```\n\nThis will correctly output the expected results."
