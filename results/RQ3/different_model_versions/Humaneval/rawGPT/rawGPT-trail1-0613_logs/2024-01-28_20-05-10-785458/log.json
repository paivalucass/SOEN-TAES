    "FinalCode": "The function `simplify(x, n)` takes in two string representations of fractions, `x` and `n`. It checks if the product of `x` and `n` evaluates to a whole number.\n\nTo determine this, the function parses the numerator and denominator of each fraction and performs the multiplication. It then checks if the numerator is evenly divisible by the denominator, indicating that the product is a whole number.\n\nIf the product is a whole number, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nHere are some examples of how the function should behave:\n\n- `simplify(\"1/5\", \"5/1\")` should return `True` because `1/5 * 5/1 = 1 * 5 / 5 * 1 = 5/5 = 1`, which is a whole number.\n- `simplify(\"1/6\", \"2/1\")` should return `False` because `1/6 * 2/1 = 1 * 2 / 6 * 1 = 2/6`, which is not a whole number.\n- `simplify(\"7/10\", \"10/2\")` should return `False` because `7/10 * 10/2 = 7 * 10 / 10 * 2 = 70/20`, which is not a whole number."
