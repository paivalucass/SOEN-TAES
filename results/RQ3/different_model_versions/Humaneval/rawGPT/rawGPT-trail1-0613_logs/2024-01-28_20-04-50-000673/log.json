    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function named `select_words` that takes in a string `s` and a natural number `n` as input. The function is tasked to return a list of all words from the string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants. If the string `s` is empty, the function should return an empty list.\n\nThe function `select_words` is defined with the following steps:\n1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the words that satisfy the conditions.\n2. Split the string `s` into a list of words using the `.split()` method.\n3. Iterate over each word in the list of words.\n4. For each word, count the number of consonants by iterating over each character in the word using a for loop.\n5. If the count of consonants in the word is equal to `n`, add the word to the `result` list.\n6. Return the `result` list.\n\nThe code also includes some example function calls with expected output for illustration purposes."
