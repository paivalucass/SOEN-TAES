    "FinalCode": "The function `string_xor` takes in two string inputs `a` and `b`, which consists only of 1s and 0s. It performs a binary XOR operation on these inputs and returns the result as a string.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `string_xor` function:\n\n```python\ndef string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:\n    result = ''\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        if a[i] == '1' and b[i] == '1':\n            result += '0'\n        elif a[i] == '0' and b[i] == '0':\n            result += '0'\n        else:\n            result += '1'\n    return result\n```\n\nThe function initializes an empty string `result` to store the XOR result. Then, it iterates through each character of `a` and `b` using the `range` function.\n\nInside the loop, it checks if the corresponding characters at the same index in `a` and `b` are both '1'. If they are, it appends '0' to the `result` string. If they are both '0', it also appends '0' to the `result` string. Otherwise, it appends '1' to the `result` string.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` string, which is the binary XOR of `a` and `b`.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `string_xor` function:\n\n```python\n>>> string_xor('010', '110')\n'100'\n```\n\nIn this example, the binary XOR of '010' and '110' is '100', which is the returned result."
