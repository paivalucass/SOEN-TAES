    "FinalCode": "The function `sum_product` takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple consisting of the sum and product of all the integers in the list.\n\nThe function is defined with the type hints `List[int]` to indicate that the input is a list of integers and `Tuple[int, int]` to indicate that the output is a tuple of two integers.\n\nThe function has a docstring that explains its purpose and provides two example test cases.\n\nThe first example test case `sum_product([])` is expected to return `(0, 1)`, meaning that the sum of an empty list is 0 and the product of an empty list is 1.\n\nThe second example test case `sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])` is expected to return `(10, 24)`, meaning that the sum of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 is 10 and the product of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 is 24."
