    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function called `make_a_pile` that takes a positive integer `n` as input. The function aims to create a pile of `n` levels of stones. \n\nIn each level of the pile, the number of stones is determined by the following rules:\n- If `n` is odd, the number of stones in the level is the next odd number.\n- If `n` is even, the number of stones in the level is the next even number.\n\nThe function returns a list where each element represents the number of stones in a level.\n\nFor example, if `n` is 3, the function will return `[3, 5, 7]`."
