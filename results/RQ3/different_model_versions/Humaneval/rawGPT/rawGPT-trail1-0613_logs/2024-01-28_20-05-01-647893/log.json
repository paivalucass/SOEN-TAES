    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function called `tri(n)` which takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a list of the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\n\nThe Tribonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the three preceding numbers. The sequence starts with `tri(1) = 3`.\n\nThe code implements this sequence using recursion. If `n` is even, the function returns `1 + n / 2`. If `n` is odd, the function returns the sum of `tri(n - 1)`, `tri(n - 2)`, and `tri(n + 1)`.\n\nThere are also some examples provided to demonstrate the usage of the `tri(n)` function. For example, `tri(3)` should return `[1, 3, 2, 8]`."
