    "FinalCode": "To count the number of distinct characters in a given string, we can use a set data structure to store unique characters. We can iterate through each character in the string, convert it to lowercase using the `lower()` method, and add it to the set. At the end, we can return the length of the set to get the count of distinct characters.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\ndef count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:\n    distinct_chars = set()\n    for char in string:\n        distinct_chars.add(char.lower())\n    return len(distinct_chars)\n\nprint(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # output: 3\nprint(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))  # output: 4\n```\n\nThe `count_distinct_characters` function takes a string as input and initializes an empty set called `distinct_chars`. It then iterates through each character in the string, converts it to lowercase using the `lower()` method, and adds it to the `distinct_chars` set. Finally, it returns the length of the `distinct_chars` set, which gives us the count of distinct characters in the string."
