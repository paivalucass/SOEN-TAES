    "FinalCode": "The function exchange(lst1, lst2) takes two lists as input and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements between the two lists to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.\n\nThe function first checks if lst1 already contains only even numbers. If it does, it returns \"YES\" because no exchange is needed.\n\nIf lst1 contains odd numbers, the function checks if lst2 contains any even numbers. If it does, it returns \"YES\" because an exchange can be performed.\n\nIf lst2 does not contain any even numbers, the function returns \"NO\" because it is not possible to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of lst1 or lst2, whichever is larger."
