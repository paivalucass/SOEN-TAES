    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function named `get_row` which takes in a list `lst` and an integer `x`. \n\nThe function is supposed to find the integer `x` in the list and return a list of tuples representing the coordinates of `x` in the list. The coordinates are represented as (row, column), starting with 0. The coordinates are sorted initially by rows in ascending order, and within each row, the coordinates are sorted by columns in descending order.\n\nThe function implementation is missing and needs to be filled in."
