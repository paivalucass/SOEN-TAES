    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function named `triangle_area` that takes three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. The function calculates the area of the triangle and returns the result rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. If the three sides do not form a valid triangle, the function returns -1.\n\nTo determine if the three sides form a valid triangle, the function checks if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If this condition is not met, the function returns -1.\n\nThe function includes two examples to demonstrate its usage. In the first example, the function is called with the side lengths 3, 4, and 5. Since 3 + 4 > 5, the function calculates the area of the triangle and returns it as 6.00.\n\nIn the second example, the function is called with the side lengths 1, 2, and 10. Since 1 + 2 < 10, the sides do not form a valid triangle and the function returns -1.\n\nThis code appears to correctly implement the logic to calculate the area of a triangle and handle cases where the sides do not form a valid triangle."
