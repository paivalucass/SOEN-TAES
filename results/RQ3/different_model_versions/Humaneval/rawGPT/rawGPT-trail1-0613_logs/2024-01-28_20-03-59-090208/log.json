    "FinalCode": "The code defines a function named `prime_fib` that takes an integer `n` as input. The function is expected to return the `n`-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number.\n\nThe function has a docstring that explains its purpose and provides some examples of expected output.\n\nTo determine the `n`-th prime Fibonacci number, the code would need to generate Fibonacci numbers and check if each number is prime."
