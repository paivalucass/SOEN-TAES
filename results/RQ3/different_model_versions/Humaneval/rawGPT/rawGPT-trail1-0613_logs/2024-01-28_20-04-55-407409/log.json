    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function named `valid_date` which takes a date string as input and validates it according to certain rules. The function returns `True` if the date is valid and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe rules for a valid date are as follows:\n1. The date string should not be empty.\n2. The number of days should be within the valid range for the given month. For months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December), the number of days should be between 1 and 31. For months with 30 days (April, June, September, November), the number of days should be between 1 and 30. For February (month 2), the number of days should be between 1 and 29.\n3. The month should be between 1 and 12.\n4. The date string should be in the format \"mm-dd-yyyy\".\n\nThe code then provides examples of valid and invalid date strings and their expected outputs.\n\nTo use this function, you can call it with a date string as an argument and it will return `True` or `False` based on whether the date is valid."
