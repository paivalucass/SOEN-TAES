    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function named `words_string` that takes a string `s` as input. It splits the string into words based on commas or spaces and returns an array of the words.\n\nTo split the string, the code uses the `split()` method with a regex pattern `\",|\\s\"` which matches either a comma or a space. This splits the string at each comma or space and returns a list of words.\n\nThe function is then demonstrated with two test cases using the equality operator (`==`) to check if the returned list matches the expected list.\n\nThe first test case `words_string(\"Hi, my name is John\")` is expected to return `[\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"]`.\n\nThe second test case `words_string(\"One, two, three, four, five, six\")` is expected to return `[\"One\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\"]`."
