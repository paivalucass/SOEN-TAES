    "FinalCode": "The function `choose_num(x, y)` takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` as input and returns the biggest even integer number that is in the range `[x, y]` inclusive. If there is no such number, the function returns -1.\n\nHere is the code for the `choose_num()` function:\n\n```python\ndef choose_num(x, y):\n    # Check if x is greater than y\n    if x > y:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Initialize the biggest_even variable to -1\n    biggest_even = -1\n    \n    # Iterate through the range [x, y]\n    for num in range(x, y+1):\n        # Check if the number is even and greater than the current biggest_even\n        if num % 2 == 0 and num > biggest_even:\n            biggest_even = num\n    \n    return biggest_even\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nprint(choose_num(12, 15))  # Output: 14\nprint(choose_num(13, 12))  # Output: -1\n```"
