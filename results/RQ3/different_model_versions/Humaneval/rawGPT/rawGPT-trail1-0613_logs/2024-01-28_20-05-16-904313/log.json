    "FinalCode": "The function `double_the_difference` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the numbers in the list that are odd, while ignoring negative numbers and non-integer numbers.\n\nThe function can be defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef double_the_difference(lst):\n    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of squares of odd numbers\n    sum_of_squares = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the numbers in the list\n    for num in lst:\n        # Check if the number is both odd and positive\n        if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0:\n            # Square the number and add it to the sum\n            sum_of_squares += num ** 2\n    \n    # Return the sum of squares\n    return sum_of_squares\n```\n\nThe function first initializes a variable `sum_of_squares` to store the sum of squares of odd numbers. Then, it iterates through the numbers in the input list. For each number, it checks if the number is an integer, positive, and odd. If all conditions are met, it squares the number and adds it to the `sum_of_squares`. Finally, it returns the `sum_of_squares`.\n\nThe function also includes some example test cases in the docstring. For example, if the input list is `[1, 3, 2, 0]`, the function should return `1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10`. If the input list is `[-1, -2, 0]`, the function should return `0` since there are no odd and positive numbers. If the input list is `[9, -2]`, the function should return `81` since 9 is odd and positive. If the input list is `[0]`, the function should return `0` since 0 is not odd. If the input list is empty, the function should return `0`."
