    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function `parse_nested_parens` which takes a string `paren_string` as input and returns a list of integers.\n\nThe function is meant to parse nested parentheses in the `paren_string` and determine the maximum level of nesting for each group of parentheses.\n\nThe function is annotated with type hints, specifying that the input is a string and the output is a list of integers.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. It takes the input string `paren_string` and splits it into a list of groups using the `split` method, with space as the separator. Each group represents a set of nested parentheses.\n\n2. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the maximum nesting level for each group.\n\n3. It iterates over each group in the list and performs the following steps:\n\n   - It initializes a variable `max_depth` to 0, which will store the maximum nesting level for the current group.\n   \n   - It iterates over each character in the group and performs the following steps:\n   \n     - If the character is an opening parenthesis '(', it increments the `max_depth` variable by 1.\n     \n     - If the character is a closing parenthesis ')', it decrements the `max_depth` variable by 1.\n     \n     - It updates the `max_depth` variable to the maximum of its current value and 0 to ensure that the nesting level does not go below 0.\n     \n   - After iterating through all the characters in the group, it appends the `max_depth` value to the `result` list.\n   \n4. After processing all the groups, the function returns the `result` list.\n\nThe function is also provided with a docstring that explains its purpose and provides an example of how to use it.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nparse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')\n```\n\nThis will return the list `[2, 3, 1, 3]`, which represents the maximum nesting level for each group of parentheses in the input string."
