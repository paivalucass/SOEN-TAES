    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function called `do_algebra` which takes two arguments: `operator` and `operand`. \n\nThe function description explains that `operator` is a list of basic algebra operations (+, -, *, //, **) and `operand` is a list of integers. The goal is to use these two lists to build an algebraic expression and return the evaluation of this expression.\n\nThe example provided shows that given `operator['+', '*', '-']` and `operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expression `2 + 3 * 4 - 5` is built and evaluated to give the result `9`.\n\nThe function also includes some notes:\n- The length of the `operator` list is equal to the length of the `operand` list minus one.\n- The `operand` list contains non-negative integers.\n- The `operator` list has at least one operator.\n- The `operand` list has at least two operands.\n\nOverall, the function aims to perform basic algebraic operations using the given lists and return the result."
