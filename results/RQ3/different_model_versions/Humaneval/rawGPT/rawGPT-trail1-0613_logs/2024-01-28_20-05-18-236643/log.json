    "FinalCode": "The function `compare` takes two arrays as input: `game` and `guess`. These arrays represent the scores and guesses for a series of matches. \n\nThe function first initializes an empty list called `result` to store the differences between guesses and scores. \n\nThen, it iterates over the indices of the `game` array using a for loop. For each index `i`, it compares the element at that index in the `game` array with the element at the same index in the `guess` array.\n\nIf the guess is correct (i.e., the elements are equal), the difference is 0. Otherwise, the difference is the absolute value of the difference between the guess and the score.\n\nThe function appends the difference to the `result` list.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `result` list.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `compare` function:\n\n```\ncompare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])\n```\n\nThe expected output is `[0,0,0,0,3,3]`."
