    "FinalCode": "The code defines a function `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors in ascending order. Each factor is repeated in the list according to the number of times it appears in the factorization.\n\nThe function uses the `typing` module to define the return type of the function as a list of integers.\n\nThe function begins by creating an empty list to store the prime factors. It then checks if the given number `n` is divisible by 2. If it is divisible by 2, the number 2 is added to the list of factors and `n` is divided by 2 repeatedly until it is no longer divisible by 2.\n\nNext, the function checks for other prime factors starting from 3. It does this by iterating over odd numbers from 3 to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by the current number, it is added to the list of factors and `n` is divided by the current number repeatedly until it is no longer divisible by the current number.\n\nFinally, if `n` is greater than 2, it means that the remaining `n` itself is a prime factor and is added to the list of factors.\n\nThe function then returns the list of prime factors."
