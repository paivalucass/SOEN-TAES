    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function `skjkasdkd(lst)` that takes a list of integers as input. The function's purpose is to find the largest prime value from the list and return the sum of its digits.\n\nThe function is documented using a docstring that explains its purpose and provides example test cases.\n\nExample test cases:\n\n1. For the input list `[0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]`, the largest prime value is `181` and the sum of its digits is `10`. So, the expected output is `10`.\n\n2. For the input list `[1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1]`, the largest prime value is `4597` and the sum of its digits is `25`. So, the expected output is `25`.\n\n3. For the input list `[1,3,1,32,5107,34,83278,109,163,23,2323,32,30,1,9,3]`, the largest prime value is `5107` and the sum of its digits is `13`. So, the expected output is `13`.\n\n4. For the input list `[0,724,32,71,99,32,6,0,5,91,83,0,5,6]`, the largest prime value is `83` and the sum of its digits is `11`. So, the expected output is `11`.\n\n5. For the input list `[0,81,12,3,1,21]`, the largest prime value is `3` and the sum of its digits is `3`. So, the expected output is `3`.\n\n6. For the input list `[0,8,1,2,1,7]`, the largest prime value is `7` and the sum of its digits is `7`. So, the expected output is `7`."
