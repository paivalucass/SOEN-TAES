    "FinalCode": "The given function takes in an array, 'arr', representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes. The function's task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it. The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value. If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found, the function should return the node that has the smallest index.\n\nThe plucked node should be returned in a list, [smallest_value, its index]. If there are no even values or the given array is empty, the function should return an empty list.\n\nThe function provides a few examples to demonstrate its functionality:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [4, 2, 3]\nOutput: [2, 1]\nExplanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [1, 2, 3]\nOutput: [2, 1]\nExplanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: []\nOutput: []\nExplanation: The given array is empty, so the function should return an empty list.\n\nExample 4:\nInput: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]\nOutput: [0, 1]\nExplanation: 0 is the smallest value, but there are two zeros, so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.\n\nThe function has the following constraints:\n- 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000\n- 0 <= node.value"
