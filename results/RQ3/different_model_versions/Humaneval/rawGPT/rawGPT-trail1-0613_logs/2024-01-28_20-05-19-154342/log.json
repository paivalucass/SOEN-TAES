    "FinalCode": "The function `Strongest_Extension` takes two parameters: `class_name`, which is a string representing the name of a class, and `extensions`, which is a list of strings representing the names of extensions.\n\nThe function calculates the strength of each extension based on the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in its name. The strength is given by the fraction CAP - SM, where CAP is the number of uppercase letters and SM is the number of lowercase letters. \n\nThe function then finds the extension with the highest strength and returns a string in the format ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.\n\nIf there are two or more extensions with the same strength, the function chooses the one that comes first in the list.\n\nHere is an example usage of the function:\n\n```python\nresult = Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC'])\nprint(result)  # Output: 'my_class.AA'\n```"
