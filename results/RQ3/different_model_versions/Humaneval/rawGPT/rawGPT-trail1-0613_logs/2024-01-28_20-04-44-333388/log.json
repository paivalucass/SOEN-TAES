    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function named `count_nums` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the number of elements in the array whose sum of digits is greater than 0.\n\nThe function has the following steps:\n1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of elements with a sum of digits greater than 0.\n2. Iterate over each number `num` in the input array.\n3. Convert the number to a string using the `str()` function.\n4. If the number is negative (i.e., it starts with a '-'), increment `count`.\n5. If the number is positive (i.e., it does not start with a '-'), calculate the sum of its digits by converting each character in the string back to an integer and adding them together.\n6. If the sum of digits is greater than 0, increment `count`.\n7. After iterating through all the numbers, return the value of `count`.\n\nThe given code also includes sample test cases to demonstrate the expected behavior of the function."
