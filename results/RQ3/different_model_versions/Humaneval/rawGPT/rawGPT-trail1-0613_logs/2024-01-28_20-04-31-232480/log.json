    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function named `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as an argument and returns an encrypted string.\n\nThe encryption process involves rotating the alphabet by shifting each letter down by two multiplied by two places. For example, if we have the letter 'a' and we shift it down by two multiplied by two places, we will get the letter 'e'.\n\nThe function uses a loop to iterate over each character in the input string. It checks if the character is a letter using the `isalpha()` function. If it is a letter, the function calculates the encrypted letter by adding the shift value to the ASCII value of the letter. If the resulting ASCII value exceeds the range of lowercase letters (97-122), it wraps around to the beginning of the range. The encrypted letter is then added to a list. If the character is not a letter, it is added to the list as is.\n\nFinally, the function joins the list of encrypted letters into a string and returns it.\n\nHere is the updated code with added comments for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef encrypt(s):\n    # Create an empty list to store the encrypted letters\n    encrypted = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isalpha():  # Check if the character is a letter\n            # Calculate the shift value by multiplying 2 to 2\n            shift = 2 * 2\n            \n            # Calculate the ASCII value of the encrypted letter\n            encrypted_ascii = ord(char) + shift\n            \n            # Check if the resulting ASCII value exceeds the range of lowercase letters\n            if encrypted_ascii > 122:\n                # Wrap around to the beginning of the range\n                encrypted_ascii = encrypted_ascii - 26\n            \n            # Convert the encrypted ASCII value back to a character\n            encrypted_char = chr(encrypted_ascii)\n            \n            # Add the encrypted letter to the list\n            encrypted.append(encrypted_char)\n        else:\n            # Add the non-letter character to the list as is\n            encrypted.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list of encrypted letters into a string and return it\n    return ''.join(encrypted)\n```\n\nNote: The given encryption scheme is a simple Caesar cipher with a fixed shift value of 4. For a more general solution, the shift value should be made a parameter of the `encrypt` function."
