    "FinalCode": "The given code defines two functions: `poly()` and `find_zero()`.\n\nThe `poly()` function takes two arguments: `xs` (a list of coefficients) and `x` (a float). It evaluates a polynomial with the given coefficients at the given point `x` using the formula `xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n`. It uses the `enumerate()` function to iterate over the coefficients and their corresponding powers of `x`, and then uses `math.pow()` to calculate the power of `x`. The function returns the sum of these terms.\n\nThe `find_zero()` function takes one argument: `xs` (a list of coefficients). It finds a zero point `x` such that `poly(x) = 0`. It assumes that the list `xs` has an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient is the first element of the list. The function returns only one zero point, even if there are multiple zero points. The function does not check if the assumptions are valid.\n\nBoth functions are documented using docstrings that describe their purpose and expected inputs/outputs. The `find_zero()` function is also provided with example usage and expected outputs in the docstring.\n\nThe code does not include any actual function calls or execution logic."
