    "FinalCode": "The given task is to determine if it is possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations. \n\nHere is the implementation of the solution in Python:\n\n```\ndef move_one_ball(arr):\n    # Return True if the given array is empty\n    if len(arr) == 0:\n        return True\n    \n    # Find the minimum element in the array\n    min_element = min(arr)\n    \n    # Find the index of the minimum element\n    min_index = arr.index(min_element)\n    \n    # Perform right shift operations to bring the minimum element to the starting position\n    arr = arr[min_index:] + arr[:min_index]\n    \n    # Check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] < arr[i-1]:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n```\n\nThe function takes an array `arr` as input and first checks if the array is empty. If it is empty, it returns `True` because an empty array is considered sorted. \n\nNext, it finds the minimum element in the array and its index. It then performs right shift operations to bring the minimum element to the starting position (index 0) of the array. \n\nFinally, it checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the previous element. If at any point, an element is found to be smaller than the previous element, it means the array is not sorted and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if the loop completes without finding any such element, the array is considered sorted and the function returns `True`."
