    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function named `sorted_list_sum` which takes a list of strings as a parameter. The function deletes the strings that have odd lengths from the list and returns the resulted list with a sorted order.\n\nThe function first checks if the length of each string in the list is odd. If the length is odd, the string is removed from the list. After deleting all the strings with odd lengths, the function sorts the list in ascending order based on the length of each word. If two words have the same length, the list is sorted alphabetically.\n\nThe function then returns the sorted list of strings.\n\nThe code also includes two example assertions to demonstrate the expected behavior of the function. These assertions check if the function produces the correct output for the given input.\n\nThe function documentation provides a description of the function, including the parameter, return type, and expected behavior."
