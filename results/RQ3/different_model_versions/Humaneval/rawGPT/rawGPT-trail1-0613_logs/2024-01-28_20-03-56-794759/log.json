    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function `fizz_buzz` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13.\n\nThe function uses a nested for loop to iterate through all integers less than `n`. For each integer, it checks if it is divisible by either 11 or 13 using the modulus operator `%`. If the integer is divisible, it converts it to a string and counts the number of occurrences of the digit 7 using the `count` method. The count is then added to a running total.\n\nFinally, the function returns the total count of digit 7 occurrences.\n\nThe function has been documented using docstrings that describe its purpose and provide examples of its usage."
