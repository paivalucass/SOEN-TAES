    "FinalCode": "The given code defines a function `fruit_distribution(s,n)` that takes in a string `s` and an integer `n` as input.\n\nThe function aims to determine the number of mango fruits in a basket, given the total number of oranges and apples in the basket.\n\nTo solve the problem, the function subtracts the count of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket (`n`) and returns the result.\n\nThe function includes examples with expected outputs to demonstrate how it works."
