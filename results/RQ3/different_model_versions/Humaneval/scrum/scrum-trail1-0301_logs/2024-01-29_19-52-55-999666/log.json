The interface should be designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, and clearly display the necessary input fields. It should also provide clear instructions on how to use the function. In addition, it should include error handling for invalid inputs and display informative error messages to the user. To provide feedback to the user on the status of the function, a loading spinner or progress bar could be added. As a professional product owner, I will ensure that the function is thoroughly tested with a variety of input values to ensure it is working correctly. User acceptance testing will also be conducted to ensure that the interface is intuitive and easy to use. Additionally, error handling will be tested to ensure that informative error messages are displayed to the user.
