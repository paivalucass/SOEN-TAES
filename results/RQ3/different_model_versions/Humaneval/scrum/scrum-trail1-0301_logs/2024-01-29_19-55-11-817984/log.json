    "DesignDraft0": "Design:\n\nThe requirement is to design a user-friendly bracketing function that takes in a string of opening and closing brackets ('<' and '>') and returns True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and False otherwise. The function should be case-insensitive and handle other characters besides '<' and '>', handle empty input strings and input strings with only opening or closing brackets, and ensure scalability and performance with very long input strings. \n\nTo solve this requirement efficiently, we can use a stack data structure. The idea is to push every opening bracket ('<') onto a stack and pop from the stack when a corresponding closing bracket ('>') is found. If there are any opening brackets left on the stack after processing the entire string, then the function should return False.\n\nHere is a high-level design for the correct_bracketing() function:\n\n1. Initialize an empty stack\n2. Loop through the input string:\n    a. If the current character is an opening bracket ('<'), push it onto the stack\n    b. If the current character is a closing bracket ('>'), pop from the stack if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is an opening bracket ('<'). If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an opening bracket, return False\n    c. If the current character is not a bracket ('<' or '>'), ignore it\n3. If the stack is not empty after processing the entire string, return False\n4. If the stack is empty, return True\n\nNote: This design is high-level and focused on guiding the developer in writing code, rather than providing implementation details. The developer should use their knowledge of the programming language and available data structures to implement the design efficiently.",
