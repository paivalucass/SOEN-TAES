The function 'sum_product' takes a list of integers as an input and returns a tuple consisting of the sum and product of all the integers in the list. The code also checks for empty input cases and returns the expected output. \n\nAs the code passes all the tests, we can conclude that the code is working properly, and there are no issues found in the code."
