    },
    "DesignDraft0": "Design:\n\nThe goal of this requirement is to create a function called \"incr_list\" that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with all elements incremented by 1. To ensure that the function is designed to meet the specific needs of the market and is scalable and performant, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. Data Structure: Since the function will be dealing with a list of integers, we need to consider the data structure that will be used to store the list. Instead of using a regular list, we can consider using a numpy array, which is a more efficient data structure for numerical operations.\n\n2. Performance: To determine which implementation is more performant, we need to benchmark both list and numpy array implementations. This will help us identify which implementation is faster and more efficient in terms of memory usage and processing time.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, we can provide the following design for the \"incr_list\" function:\n\nDesign for incr_list:\n\n- Use a numpy array to store the list of integers\n- Iterate through the numpy array and increment each element by 1\n- Return the numpy array as a list\n\nExample code:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef incr_list(l: list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return list with elements incremented by 1.\n    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])\n    [2, 3, 4]\n    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])\n    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]\n    \"\"\"\n    # convert list to numpy array\n    arr = np.array(l)\n    \n    # increment each element by 1\n    arr += 1\n    \n    # convert numpy array back to list and return\n    return arr.tolist()",
    "DesignMeetings0": "{\n  \"Developer\": \"The design seems good overall. However, I suggest adding some input validation to ensure that the input is a list of integers. This can prevent unexpected errors or bugs. Additionally, we can consider adding support for other data structures besides lists and numpy arrays. This can increase the flexibility of the function and make it more useful for a wider range of use cases.\",\n  \"Tester\": \"As a tester, I suggest thoroughly testing the function with different input values, including edge cases and large inputs, to ensure that it works as expected and can handle different scenarios. We should also test the performance of the function with both list and numpy array implementations to confirm that the efficiency is as expected. Additionally, we can consider adding some testing for the input validation mentioned by the developer to ensure that the function handles invalid input correctly.\" \n}",
