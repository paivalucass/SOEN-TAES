I will incorporate the suggestion of incorporating machine learning algorithms to improve its accuracy. I will also test it thoroughly using a variety of input data, including edge cases such as empty lists and lists with only one element. Additionally, I will conduct user acceptance testing to gather feedback from potential customers and incorporate their suggestions into the development process. I may also consider incorporating a caching system to improve the efficiency of the function and reduce processing time.\\\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Add more test cases to ensure function works properly for edge cases', 'Add test cases for extreme values to ensure the function works correctly']\\n# Design:\\nDesign:\\n\\nTo further improve the efficiency and reliability of the monotonic() function, we will incorporate the following suggestions from our colleagues:\\n\\n1. Developer: We will implement unit tests to ensure that the function is working correctly and efficiently. This will also help to catch any bugs in the code before the function is deployed. We will also perform error handling to address cases where invalid inputs are provided, such as non-list or non-numeric elements. This will significantly improve the robustness of the function and provide a better user experience.\\n\\n2. Tester: We will conduct more edge case testing, such as testing with very large or very small lists, to ensure that the function is scalable and efficient. We will also perform load testing to determine the maximum number of requests the function can handle before experiencing performance issues. Additionally, we will incorporate user feedback into the testing process to ensure that the function meets the needs of the target audience.\\n\\nTo implement the binary search algorithm, we will compare the middle element of the list to the element at the start and end of the list. If the middle element is greater than the start and end elements, then the list is increasing, and we only need to search the right half of the list. Similarly, if the middle element is less than the start and end elements, then the list is decreasing, and we only need to search the left half of the list. This process will be repeated until we have determined whether the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.\\n\\nWe will also incorporate a caching system to improve the efficiency of the function and reduce processing time. This will involve storing the results of previous function calls and returning the cached result if the same input is provided again. However, we will carefully evaluate the trade-offs between caching and memory usage to ensure that the function remains scalable and efficient.\\n\\nWe will thoroughly test the function using a variety of input data, including empty lists and lists with only one element, to ensure that it is working correctly. Additionally, we will conduct user acceptance testing to gather feedback from potential customers and incorporate their suggestions into the development process. \\n\\nOverall, these improvements will significantly enhance the efficiency, reliability, and user experience of the monotonic() function.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef monotonic(l: list):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Return True is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.\\n    >>> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])\\n    True\\n    >>> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])\\n    False\\n    >>> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])\\n    True\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
