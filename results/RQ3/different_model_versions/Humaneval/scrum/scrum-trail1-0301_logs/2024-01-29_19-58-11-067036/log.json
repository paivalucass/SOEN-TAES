Before processing the input parameters, input validation should be performed to ensure that both input parameters are indeed lists of strings. This will prevent unexpected behavior if non-string elements are included in the input parameters. \\n\\nThe function should then use built-in functions like sum() and len() to simplify the code and improve performance. A sub-function can be created to calculate the total number of characters in a list of strings. Another sub-function can be created to compare the total number of characters in both lists and return the appropriate list. This approach will make the code easier to read, understand, and maintain.\\n\\nTo ensure that the function is thoroughly tested for usability and accessibility, automated and manual testing should be performed. The function should be tested with different types of input parameters, such as empty lists, lists with only one string, and lists with non-string elements. Long lists should also be tested to check for performance issues.\\n\\nAdditionally, the feature to switch between input lists should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it works as expected and does not cause any unexpected behavior. The user interface should be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and devices, and user testing sessions should be conducted to ensure that the user interface is accessible and easy to use.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef total_match(lst1, lst2):\\n    '''\\n    Write a function that accepts two lists of strings and returns the list that has \\n    total number of chars in the all strings of the list less than the other list.\\n\\n    if the two lists have the same number of chars, return the first list.\\n\\n    Examples\\n    total_match([], []) \\u279e []\\n    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']) \\u279e ['hI', 'Hi']\\n    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']) \\u279e ['hi', 'admin']\\n    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']) \\u279e ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']\\n    total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']) \\u279e ['4']\\n    '''\\n\"}",
