Based on their requests, I may consider adding additional features to enhance the functionality of these functions. To achieve this, it would be beneficial to include a feedback mechanism within the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions, which could prompt the user to provide feedback after using the functions. Additionally, it may be helpful to identify the most common requests from users and prioritize their implementation. To ensure that the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions meet user needs and requests, it would be important to thoroughly test the functions with different inputs and scenarios. It may also be useful to gather a group of beta testers to provide feedback on the functionality and ease of use of the functions. Any issues or bugs found during testing should be addressed before implementing additional features.\\\",\\n    \\\"Analysis\\\": \\\"The revised document incorporates the suggestions provided by the architect and tester to include a feedback mechanism and prioritize user requests for additional features. Thoroughly testing the functions and addressing any issues or bugs found during testing is also emphasized. The analysis is high-level and does not provide implementation details.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Add test cases to ensure correct functionality for different input types and lengths']\\n# Design:\\nNew design for feedback mechanism and prioritization of user requests:\\n\\nTo ensure that the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions meet user needs and requests, a feedback prompt should be added at the end of both functions. This prompt should request user feedback on the functionality and ease of use of the functions.\\n\\nThe gathered feedback should be analyzed to identify the most common user requests. Based on the identified requests, additional features can be added to enhance the functionality of the functions. Prioritization of these features should be based on their popularity among users.\\n\\nTo thoroughly test the functions and address any issues or bugs found during testing, a group of beta testers should be gathered. The feedback from the beta testers should be used to refine the functions and ensure their ease of use. The testing and refinement process should be ongoing to ensure the effectiveness and ease of use of the functions.\\n\\nOverall, this design prioritizes user feedback and prioritizes the implementation of features that are most commonly requested by users. It also ensures thorough testing and refinement of the functions to ensure their effectiveness and ease of use.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef encode_cyclic(s: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    # split string to groups.
