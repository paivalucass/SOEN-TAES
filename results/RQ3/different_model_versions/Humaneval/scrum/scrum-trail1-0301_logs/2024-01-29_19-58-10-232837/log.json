    "DesignDraft0": "Design:\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic, we can use dynamic programming as the algorithm. \n\nOur approach will be to break down the problem into smaller sub-problems. We can consider each sub-array of the given array as a separate problem. For each sub-array, we can find the minimum number of changes required to make it palindromic. We can then use the results of the sub-problems to solve the main problem.\n\nThe solution will be a function named \"smallest_change\" that takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.\n\nHere is the high-level design of the function:\n\n1. Define a function named smallest_change that takes an array of integers as input.\n\n2. Create a two-dimensional array of size n x n, where n is the length of the input array.\n\n3. Fill the diagonal elements of the matrix with 0, as each element is already a palindrome itself.\n\n4. Initialize the upper triangular matrix elements with the absolute difference of the values of the corresponding lower triangular matrix element, as we can change any element to any other element.\n\n5. Use dynamic programming to fill the remaining elements of the matrix. For each element (i, j), find the minimum of (i+1, j), (i, j-1), and (i+1, j-1) elements of the matrix and add 1 if the current elements are not equal. \n\n6. The value at the last element of the matrix will be the minimum number of changes required to make the whole array palindromic.\n\n7. Return the value at the last element of the matrix.\n\nThe design focuses on guiding the developer in writing code, rather than providing implementation details. Further, as suggested by the Architect, we can efficiently find the minimum number of changes required, and as suggested by the Tester, we can test the function with different types of arrays, including large arrays and arrays with negative integers, to ensure that the function handles all cases effectively.",
