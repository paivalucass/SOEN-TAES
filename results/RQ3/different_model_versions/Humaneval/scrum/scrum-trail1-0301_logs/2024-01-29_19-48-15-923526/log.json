If there are multiple strings of the same length, the function should return the first one. If the input list is empty, the endpoint should return None.\\n\\nRequest format:\\n- The input to the API will be a JSON payload containing a list of strings.\\n\\nResponse format:\\n- The API will return a JSON response with the longest string from the input list.\\n\\nAPI Versioning:\\n- API versioning will be added to prevent breaking changes from affecting clients using the API.\\n\\nCaching:\\n- Caching will be implemented to improve performance and reduce server load.\\n\\nDatabase:\\n- A database will be used to store and retrieve the longest string instead of computing it every time a request is made.\\n\\nAuthentication and authorization:\\n- The API will not require any authentication or authorization.\\n\\nError handling:\\n- The API will handle errors related to invalid input data, such as non-string inputs, empty list inputs, or invalid JSON payloads.\\n- In case of errors, the API will return an appropriate error message with a relevant HTTP status code.\\n\\nTesting:\\n- The API will be tested using both manual and automated testing approaches.\\n- Test cases will cover positive and negative scenarios, boundary conditions, and error cases.\\n- Testing tools such as pytest will be used.\\n- A test environment will be set up to ensure the API meets performance and security testing requirements.\\n\\nScalability and maintainability:\\n- The API will be designed for scalability, using techniques such as caching and load balancing.\\n- The API will be designed for maintainability, using best practices such as code modularization and version control.\\n- Load testing tools will be used to ensure the API meets performance testing requirements.\", \"Question\": \"from typing import List, Optional\\n\\n\\ndef longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" Out of list of strings, return the longest one.
