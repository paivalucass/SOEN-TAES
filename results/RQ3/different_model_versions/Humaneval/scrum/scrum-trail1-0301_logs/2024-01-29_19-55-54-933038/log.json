The interface will include a visual representation of the opening and closing brackets to help the user identify the pairing of the brackets. A tooltip or a pop-up message will be provided when hovering over the brackets to explain the correct syntax of the input.

The function will first validate the string to ensure that it contains only opening and closing brackets. This validation will be performed by a separate function called validate_string.\\n\\nThe main function will then use a stack data structure to efficiently keep track of opening and closing brackets. The function will iterate through each character in the brackets string and push each opening bracket onto the stack. If a closing bracket is encountered, the top element of the stack should be popped off and checked for matching with the closing bracket. If they match, the iteration should continue and the next character should be processed. If they do not match, the function should return False.\\n\\nTo make the function more modular, the validation and bracket checking logic will be separated into two separate functions called validate_string and check_brackets, respectively.\\n\\nTo make the function more robust, try-except blocks will be used to handle any unexpected errors that may occur while processing the input string.\\n\\nThe function will be tested with various input sizes and formats to ensure that it can handle them correctly.

Negative testing will also be performed to ensure that the function can handle invalid or unexpected input, such as special characters or non-bracket symbols.
