This will help us understand the potential market for the product and make informed decisions about whether or not to proceed with its development. Based on the user story, it may be helpful to conduct a feasibility study to determine if the Fib4 function is suitable for the product. This can help identify any technical limitations and ensure that the product can be developed efficiently. Additionally, it may be useful to consider the scalability of the product and ensure that it can accommodate potential growth in the market. For testing, it may be helpful to conduct a usability test with potential users to determine their understanding of the Fib4 function and how it relates to the product. Additionally, it may be useful to perform regression testing to ensure that any changes made to the function do not negatively impact the overall performance of the product. It's also important to consider any security concerns related to the function and test accordingly.\\\",\\n  \\\"Analysis\\\": \\\"The suggestions provided by my colleagues are helpful in identifying potential technical limitations and ensuring that the product can be developed efficiently.

I have also implemented memoization to further optimize the performance of the function by storing the results of previously computed values in a dictionary and retrieving them when needed.\\n\\nNext, we can use an iterative approach to optimize space complexity. We can start by initializing a dictionary with keys 0 and 1 and values 0 and 1 respectively. Then, we can iterate from index 2 to n, and for each index i, we can compute the value of fib4(i) by adding the values of the previous two elements in the dictionary (i.e., fib4(i-1) and fib4(i-2)). We can update the dictionary with the computed value.\\n\\nFinally, we can return the value of the n-th element in the dictionary, which represents the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence.\\n\\nHere is the updated code:\\n\\ndef fib4(n: int) -> int:\\n    if n < 0:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"n must be a non-negative integer.\\\")\\n    fib = {0: 0, 1: 1}\\n    for i in range(2, n+1):\\n        fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]\\n    return fib[n]\\n\\nThis updated design includes error handling and memoization to improve the function's robustness and performance respectively.
