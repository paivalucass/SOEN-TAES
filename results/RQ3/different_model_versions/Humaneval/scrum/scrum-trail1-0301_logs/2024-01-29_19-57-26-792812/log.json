Input Validation: The function will now validate all input side measurements to ensure that they are numeric and in a consistent unit of measurement. If invalid input is detected, the function will return an error message.\\n\\n2. Error Handling: Error handling has been added to handle cases where non-numeric values are entered as inputs. This will prevent the function from crashing and provide a user-friendly error message.\\n\\n3. Unit Conversion: A unit conversion feature has been added to allow users to enter side measurements in any unit of measurement they prefer. The function will automatically convert the input to a consistent unit of measurement for calculation.\\n\\n4. Thorough Testing: Both manual and automated testing will be performed to ensure the functionality, accuracy, and reliability of the function. Testing will include various input combinations of side measurements in different units of measurement, including edge cases such as negative input values and input values that result in a triangle with zero area.\\n\\nWith these changes, the triangle_area() function will be more accurate, reliable, and user-friendly, and will provide a better user experience.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef triangle_area(a, b, c):\\n    '''\\n    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
