The function should calculate the mean of the input list using the built-in Python function sum(). Then, for each element in the list, the absolute difference between the element and the mean should be calculated and added to a running total. Finally, the running total should be divided by the length of the input list to get the average absolute difference, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation.\\n\\nTo ensure the function is well-tested, the following edge cases and error handling should be implemented:\\n\\n- The function should have a clear name like 'calculate_mean_absolute_deviation'.\\n- If the input list is empty, the function should return 0.0.\\n- If the input list contains non-numeric values, the function should raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message.\\n- To handle floating point precision issues, the function should use the built-in Python function math.isclose() to compare floating-point values.\\n- The function should return the Mean Absolute Deviation as a float value.\\n\\nTest cases:\\n\\n- Test the function with an empty input list and verify that it returns 0.0.\\n- Test the function with a list containing non-numeric values and verify that it raises a ValueError with an appropriate error message.\\n- Test the function with a list of floating-point numbers and verify that it returns the correct Mean Absolute Deviation value.\\n- Test the function with edge cases, such as a list containing only one element or a list containing multiple identical elements.\", \"Question\": \"from typing import List\\n\\n\\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation\\n    around the mean of this dataset.\\n    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each\\n    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):\\n    MAD = average | x - x_mean |\\n    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])\\n    1.0\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
