Finally, the integration of the search function with the existing unique() function should be tested to ensure a seamless user experience. Automated tests and manual tests should be used to cover all scenarios and edge cases.\\\"\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Add test cases for edge cases and duplicates in the unique() function']\\n# Design:\\nNew Design:\\n\\nTo achieve efficient search times for the unique() function, we can implement a balanced binary search tree data structure like AVL or Red-Black Tree. This data structure can efficiently search for unique elements in the list, even for large lists of integers. \\n\\nInstead of sorting the entire list, we can use Quickselect algorithm to find the k-th smallest element and partition the list into elements smaller than, equal to, and greater than the k-th element. This can provide a more efficient search for unique elements.\\n\\nTo further improve performance, we can use a hash table to store previously searched lists and their unique elements to avoid repeating the search for the same input. This caching mechanism can significantly reduce the time required to search for unique elements in large lists.\\n\\nThe search function should be designed in a way that allows easy integration with the existing unique() function. This can be achieved by defining the search function as a separate module that can be imported and used by the unique() function. The search function should take a list as input and return a sorted list of unique elements.\\n\\nTo ensure optimal performance in all scenarios, we should test the search function with different sizes of input lists ranging from small to large. Additionally, we should test with input lists that have duplicate elements to ensure accurate removal of duplicates and with input lists that have elements in descending order to ensure accurate sorting of remaining elements in ascending order. We should also test the integration of the search function with the unique() function to ensure a seamless user experience. We can use automated tests and manual tests to cover all scenarios and edge cases.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef unique(l: list):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Return sorted unique elements in a list\\n    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])\\n    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
