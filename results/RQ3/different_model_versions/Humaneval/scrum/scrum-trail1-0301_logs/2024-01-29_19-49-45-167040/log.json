Implement type check to validate input list:\n   - Before filtering the list for integers, the function should check if all the elements in the input list are of type int or can be cast to int. This can be achieved using the isinstance function to check for int type and try-except block to handle the casting errors.\n   - If any element in the input list is not of int type or cannot be cast to int, the function should raise a TypeError with an appropriate error message.\n\n2. Implement data validation to enhance reliability:\n   - In addition to the type check, the function should also validate the input data for any invalid values or edge cases that can cause unexpected behavior or errors.\n   - One such edge case can be filtering a large dataset. To handle this, the function should use a generator expression to avoid loading the entire list into memory and filter the elements one by one.\n   - Another edge case can be filtering for uncommon data types. To handle this, the function should have a flexible design that can be extended to filter for other data types as well.\n\nBy implementing the above design, the filter_integers function can efficiently filter a list of any Python values for integers and enhance the interface's usability.
