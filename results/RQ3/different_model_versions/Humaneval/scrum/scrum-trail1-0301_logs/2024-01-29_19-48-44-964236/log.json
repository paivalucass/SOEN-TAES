However, there could be some improvements. Instead of using range() function to generate the sequence of numbers, we could use a loop to generate the numbers and add it to a list.

Specifically, designing a function that takes in the starting number and ending number, and returns the string with space-delimited numbers would be a good way to ensure modularity and maintainability. Additionally, error handling should be implemented for cases where the input is not a valid number or the ending number is less than the starting number.
