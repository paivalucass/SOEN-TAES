Additionally, we should optimize the code for better performance and scalability, especially if the function will be used in large-scale systems. We should thoroughly test the function with a variety of input values, including edge cases, to ensure that it can handle different scenarios and produce accurate and reliable results. Finally, we should document the testing process and results to ensure that the function meets all the requirements and specifications.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Add test cases with different inputs and outputs to ensure the function works correctly.']\\n# Design:\\nNew Design:\\n\\nTo implement the suggestions provided by our colleagues, we can enhance the functionality of the triples_sum_to_zero function by adding a command-line interface or a GUI with buttons and input fields. This will improve the user-friendliness of the function and provide visual feedback to easily understand and use the function. Additionally, we can implement error handling to handle invalid inputs and edge cases.\\n\\nTo ensure that the function adheres to SOLID principles, we can design the function as a microservice with RESTful API endpoints. This will create a modular and extensible solution that will optimize the performance and scalability of the function in large-scale systems.\\n\\nTo thoroughly test the function, we can create test cases that cover various scenarios, including large input sizes and edge cases such as empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with only positive or negative numbers. We should also check for accuracy and reliability by comparing the results to manual calculations and other similar functions. We can document the testing process and results by creating a test plan and report that includes the test cases, expected results, actual results, and any issues or bugs found during testing.\\n\\nIn terms of implementation, the function can be designed as follows:\\n\\n1. Receive a list of integers as an input.\\n2. Generate all possible combinations of three elements from the list.\\n3. Check if the sum of any of these combinations is equal to zero.\\n4. If a sum of zero is found, return True. Otherwise, return False.\\n\\nTo optimize performance, we can sort the input list and break out early if we find a sum greater than zero. We can also use memoization to avoid repeating calculations for the same combination of elements.\\n\\nOverall, the design should prioritize user-friendliness, modular design, and scalability while ensuring the function produces accurate and reliable results.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.\\n    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that\\n    sum to zero, and False otherwise.\\n\\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])\\n    False\\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])\\n    True\\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])\\n    False\\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])\\n    True\\n    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])\\n    False\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
