Based on their suggestions, I propose breaking down the encoding and decoding functions into smaller, more modular components to make it easier to maintain and potentially reuse the components elsewhere. Additionally, I suggest creating comprehensive test cases for the encoding and decoding functions that include both positive and negative scenarios. We should also establish a way to track user feedback and bug reports to ensure timely resolution of any issues. With these changes, our user story of being able to encode and decode strings using a shift function while gathering user feedback and prioritizing features based on requirements should be even more effective and efficient.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Thoroughly test the encode_shift and decode_shift functions']\\n# Design:\\nNew Design:\\n\\n1. Module Decomposition:\\n\\nTo improve the maintainability and reusability of the code, separate modules for encoding and decoding functions and for handling user feedback and bug reports should be created. The encoding and decoding functions should also be split into smaller, more modular components.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n- A separate module for encoding functions that contains smaller modular functions to encode different types of data.\\n- A separate module for decoding functions that contains smaller modular functions to decode different types of data.\\n- A separate module for handling user feedback and bug reports that includes functions to track and prioritize issues.\\n\\n2. Comprehensive Test Cases:\\n\\nTo ensure the quality of the code and the correctness of the encoding and decoding functions, comprehensive test cases should be created that cover both positive and negative scenarios. Test cases for different input sizes and input with special characters should also be included.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n- Test cases for different types of data, such as text, numbers, and binary data.\\n- Test cases for different input sizes and input with special characters.\\n- Test cases for negative scenarios, such as input that contains invalid characters or is too large.\\n\\n3. Security:\\n\\nTo ensure the security of the encoding and decoding functions, different encryption algorithms should be researched and explored. The algorithm chosen should be based on its security and efficiency.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n- Research and explore different encryption algorithms, such as AES and RSA.\\n- Choose the encryption algorithm based on its security and efficiency.\\n\\n4. User Feedback:\\n\\nTo ensure timely resolution of any issues, a feedback mechanism that allows users to report issues and a system to track and prioritize issues based on requirements should be established.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n- A feedback mechanism that allows users to report issues and provide feedback.\\n- A system to track and prioritize issues based on requirements and severity.\\n\\nCode Design:\\n\\nThe encoding and decoding functions should be split into smaller, modular functions to improve efficiency and maintainability. A more efficient algorithm for encoding and decoding should also be used.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n- Split the encoding and decoding functions into smaller, modular functions to make them easier to maintain and potentially reuse the components elsewhere.\\n- Use a more efficient algorithm for encoding and decoding, such as Base64.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef encode_shift(s: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    return \\\"\\\".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord(\\\"a\\\")) % 26) + ord(\\\"a\\\")) for ch in s])\\n\\n\\ndef decode_shift(s: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function.
