To achieve this, we will consider the following design aspects:\n\n1. Algorithm Selection: The current implementation of the function iterates through each string in the input list and checks whether the substring is present in it. This approach has a time complexity of O(nm), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the substring. To optimize the performance of the function, we will consider using a more efficient algorithm such as the Boyer-Moore algorithm, which has a worst-case time complexity of O(n+m).\n\n2.

Handling Edge Cases: The function should handle edge cases such as empty input lists and substrings that are longer than the strings in the input list.\n\n4.

To achieve this, I will gather feedback from potential users during development to understand their needs and preferences. The function should return a list of strings that contain the given substring and satisfy the user's requirements. The function should also handle edge cases and validate input parameters to ensure that it works as expected. To evaluate the efficiency of the function, performance benchmarks will be added. Additionally, caching or other optimization techniques will be implemented to improve the speed of the function. A more advanced algorithm for string matching, such as the Boyer-Moore algorithm, will also be considered. Thorough testing of the edge cases and input validation will be conducted to ensure that the function is robust. User acceptance testing will also be done to gather feedback and ensure that the function meets the needs and preferences of potential users. Large datasets will be used to test the function to ensure that it can handle larger inputs without performance issues.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Add more test cases to ensure the function works properly with different inputs, including edge cases and negative inputs.']\\n# Design:\\nDesign:\\n\\nTo optimize the filter_by_substring function for better performance and user experience, we should consider the following design aspects:\\n\\n1. Algorithm Selection: The current implementation of the function has a time complexity of O(nm), where n is the number of strings and m is the length of the substring. To optimize the performance of the function, we should implement the Boyer-Moore algorithm, which has a worst-case time complexity of O(n+m).\\n\\n2. Input Validation: The function should validate the input parameters to ensure that they are of the correct type and format. Specifically, we should check that the input list contains only strings and the substring is not empty.\\n\\n3. Handling Edge Cases: The function should handle edge cases such as empty input lists and substrings that are longer than the strings in the input list.\\n\\n4. Caching and Optimization Techniques: To improve the speed of the function, we should consider implementing caching or other optimization techniques such as memoization.\\n\\n5. Performance Benchmarking: We will add performance benchmarks to evaluate the efficiency of the function and identify areas for optimization.\\n\\n6. Thorough Testing: The function should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is robust and handles edge cases correctly. User acceptance testing should also be conducted to gather feedback and ensure that the function meets the needs and preferences of potential users.\\n\\n7. Large Datasets: The function should be tested with large datasets to ensure that it can handle larger inputs without performance issues.\\n\\nBased on these design considerations, we recommend the following guidelines for implementing the optimized filter_by_substring function:\\n\\n1. Implement the Boyer-Moore algorithm to optimize the function's time complexity.\\n\\n2. Include input validation to check for correct type and format of input parameters (input list should contain only strings and the substring should not be empty).\\n\\n3. Handle edge cases such as empty input lists and substrings longer than the strings in the input list.\\n\\n4. Implement caching or memoization to improve function speed.\\n\\n5.
