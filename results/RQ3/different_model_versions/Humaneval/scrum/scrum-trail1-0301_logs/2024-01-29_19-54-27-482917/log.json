The error message should clearly state what input is missing.\n\n2. The function should break down the input list l into smaller, reusable modules to increase maintainability and scalability. This can be achieved by using helper functions to perform specific tasks, such as iterating over the list and checking if each number is below the threshold.\n\n3. The function should handle large lists of numbers efficiently by iterating over the list using a generator or iterator, rather than reading the entire list into memory at once.\n\n4. The function should be thoroughly tested, including scenarios with empty lists, negative numbers, and large lists of numbers.
