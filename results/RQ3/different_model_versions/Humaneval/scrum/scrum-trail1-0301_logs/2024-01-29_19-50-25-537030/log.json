The 'keep_duplicates' parameter is a boolean value that specifies whether to keep or remove duplicates. The default value is False, which means duplicates will be removed. \n\nThe 'order' parameter is a string that specifies the order in which the elements should be returned in the list. The default value is 'input', which means the order of the elements left in the list will be the same as in the input. If 'order' is set to 'ascending' or 'descending', the elements in the output list will be in the specified order.\n\nTo guide the developer in writing code, the high-level design of the function is provided. It is the developer's responsibility to implement the hash table solution in the function to remove duplicates in linear time. \n\nAs a tester, it is suggested to test the function with different input scenarios, including lists with various numbers of duplicate elements and different configurations of keep/remove duplicates. Additionally, edge cases such as empty lists and lists with only one element should be tested to ensure the function works correctly. It should also be verified that the order of the elements left in the list is the same as in the input and that the function returns the expected output for all input scenarios.",

    "TestReport3": "Test Report:\n\nThe test script output indicates that the test case for the function \"remove_duplicates\" has failed. The output shows that the expected output was [1,3,4], but the actual output was [1,2,3,4]. The test script also shows that the first differing element was 2 and the first extra element was 3.\n\nAs a quality assurance engineer, I have analyzed the output and have concluded that the code has failed the test. The input was [1, 2, 3, 2, 4], and the expected output was [1, 3, 4]. However, the actual output was [1, 2, 3, 4], which is not the expected output.\n\nTherefore, I recommend that the developer should review the code and fix the issues to ensure that the function \"remove_duplicates\" produces the expected output.\n\nCode Test Failed."
