Algorithm complexity and efficiency: Consider the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms before finalizing the implementation. The selected algorithm should have a reasonable performance for the expected input range.\n\n2. Search bar: Add a search bar on the interface to make it easier for users to find the GCD function.\n\n3. Explanation: Include a brief explanation of what the GCD function does and how it is calculated, in case the user is not familiar with the concept.\n\n4. Error handling: Add error handling to the GCD function to handle non-integer values or if one of the inputs is zero, the function will return an error message instead of crashing.\n\n5. Test cases: Include some test cases in the documentation to ensure the function is working correctly under different scenarios and inputs.\n\nBased on the above design principles, the following high-level design can be proposed for the greatest_common_divisor function:\n\n1. Input validation: Before proceeding with the actual calculation, validate the inputs to ensure that they are integers and both are non-zero. If one of the inputs is zero or not an integer, return an error message.\n\n2. Determine the smaller number: Determine the smaller number between a and b.\n\n3. Find the GCD: Starting from the smaller number, iterate down to 1 and check if both a and b are divisible by the current number. If yes, return the current number as the GCD.\n\n4.

Furthermore, we will add error handling to the GCD function to handle non-integer values or if one of the inputs is zero, the function will return an error message instead of crashing. We will also include some test cases in the documentation to ensure the function is working correctly under different scenarios and inputs.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Add more test cases to ensure the function works for all possible inputs.']\\n# Design:\\nTo improve the current design for the GCD function, I propose the following changes based on the suggestions from my colleague:\\n\\n1. Algorithm optimization: Implement an optimized algorithm for calculating the GCD, such as Euclid's algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(log(min(a,b))). This will improve the performance of the function for larger inputs.\\n\\n2. Keyboard shortcuts: Add keyboard shortcuts for quick access to the GCD function. This will enhance the user experience and make it easier for users to access the function.\\n\\n3. Multiple inputs: Consider adding a feature to calculate GCD for multiple numbers at once. This will provide more flexibility to users and reduce the need for repeated calculations.\\n\\n4. Modular code: Use a modular approach to code design to make the code more maintainable and readable. This will help developers to easily understand and modify the code as needed.\\n\\n5. Data structures and algorithms: Use appropriate data structures and algorithms to handle large input sizes. This will ensure that the function can handle large inputs without slowing down the system.\\n\\nIn addition to the above changes, I suggest that the following test cases be included to ensure the proper functioning of the GCD function:\\n\\n1. Edge cases: Test the function with input values of 0, negative numbers, and very large integers to ensure that it handles these cases correctly.\\n\\n2. Error handling: Verify that the error handling is working correctly for non-integer inputs and when one of the inputs is 0.\\n\\n3. Test suite: Develop and execute a suite of test cases to ensure that the function is working correctly under different input scenarios.\\n\\n4. Output verification: Verify that the function is returning the correct output for all test cases.\\n\\n5. Performance testing: Check the performance of the function with large input sizes to ensure that it meets the design requirements.\\n\\nBy implementing these changes and performing thorough testing, we can ensure that the GCD function meets the design principles and user requirements for ease of use, performance, and accuracy.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b\\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)\\n    1\\n    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)\\n    5\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
