Additionally, I want to prioritize and analyze the feedback received to ensure that the product satisfies user needs and expectations and to identify features that add the most value. The user feedback feature will be thoroughly tested to ensure proper functionality and accurate recording of all submitted feedback. Automated tests will also be in place to catch any potential issues with the feature.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Add more test cases to ensure factorize function works correctly', 'Test factorize function in all possible scenarios']\\n# Design:\\nNew Design:\\n\\nTo improve the performance and reliability of the factorize function, we will implement the following updates to the existing design:\\n\\n1. Helper function: We will use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find the smallest prime factor of a given number. This will replace the current method of iterating through all numbers up to n to find the smallest prime factor.\\n\\n2. Memoization: We will use memoization to store previously computed factorizations and avoid redundant computations. This will significantly improve the performance of the function, especially for larger numbers.\\n\\n3. Caching mechanism: We will add a caching mechanism to further improve performance. This will allow us to quickly retrieve previously computed factorizations from memory instead of recomputing them.\\n\\n4. Error handling: We will implement error handling to handle invalid inputs such as negative numbers and non-integer inputs. This will ensure that the function works correctly and returns appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.\\n\\n5. Logging: We will add logging to track performance and identify potential bottlenecks. This will enable us to optimize the function further and improve its overall performance.\\n\\nFollowing these updates, the factorize function will work as follows:\\n\\n1. If the input number n is less than or equal to 1, return an empty list.\\n2. Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find the smallest prime factor p of n.\\n3. Divide n by p and recursively call the factorize function with the quotient.\\n4. Append p to the list returned by the recursive call.\\n5. Return the resulting list.\\n\\nBy implementing these updates, we will ensure that the factorize function is efficient, reliable, and able to handle a wide range of inputs. We recommend testing the function with the given test cases as well as additional test cases for larger numbers to verify its performance and functionality.\", \"Question\": \"from typing import List\\n\\n\\ndef factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.\\n    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.\\n    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors\\n    >>> factorize(8)\\n    [2, 2, 2]\\n    >>> factorize(25)\\n    [5, 5]\\n    >>> factorize(70)\\n    [2, 5, 7]\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
