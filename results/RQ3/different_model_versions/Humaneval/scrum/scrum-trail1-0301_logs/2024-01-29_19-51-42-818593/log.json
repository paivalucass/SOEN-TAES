Performance Testing: The document will incorporate the performance testing aspects of the feature to ensure that it can handle a large number of users without any performance issues.\\\\n\\\\nBased on the user feedback, the feature will be prioritized to ensure that it meets their needs and expectations. The revised document will provide a high-level overview of the feature rather than providing implementation details.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Include test cases for edge cases and negative scenarios in the max_element function']\\n# Design:\\nNew Design for the max_element function:\\n\\n1. Technology Stack:\\nFor implementing the max_element function, I suggest using a language that has good support for lists and arrays such as Python, Java, or C++. A library or framework that provides efficient algorithms for working with lists and arrays should be used to simplify the development process.\\n\\n2. Design Patterns:\\nThe Divide and Conquer approach is a good choice for implementing the max_element function. This approach can help to optimize the function for large lists. The function can be divided into smaller sub-problems, and then the maximum element from each sub-problem can be compared to find the overall maximum. This approach can reduce the time complexity of the function.\\n\\n3. Scalability and Security Aspects:\\nTo ensure that the max_element function can handle large lists efficiently, it should be optimized for time complexity. The function should also be designed to handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with duplicate maximum elements. Additionally, input validation and sanitization should be implemented to prevent malicious inputs and ensure the function's security.\\n\\n4. Testing Plan:\\nThe testing plan should include unit tests to validate the function's correctness for different inputs. The testing should cover all possible edge cases such as empty lists, lists with duplicate maximum elements, and lists with negative numbers. Performance testing should be conducted to verify that the function can handle large lists efficiently within the expected time frame. The testing should include benchmark tests that compare the function's performance with different list sizes.\\n\\nThe new design for the max_element function should guide the developer in writing optimized, scalable, and secure code. This design provides a high-level overview of the function and focuses on performance, scalability, and security aspects rather than implementation details.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef max_element(l: list):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Return maximum element in the list.\\n    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])\\n    3\\n    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\\n    123\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
