Additionally, user interface design should be considered and user research should be conducted to ensure an intuitive and easy-to-use sorting operation. As a tester, it is important to test the sorting algorithm with a variety of datasets to ensure correct output and test the user interface design to ensure it is user-friendly. User acceptance testing can provide valuable feedback for improving the sorting operation. However, implementation details are beyond the scope of this analysis.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Add test cases for edge cases (e.g. negative integers, duplicates, empty list)']\\n# Design:\\nNew Design:\\n\\nTo implement the strange_sort_list function, we can follow the below high-level steps:\\n\\n1. Check if the given list is empty. If yes, return an empty list.\\n2. Check if the input is a list and contains sortable elements. If not, raise a TypeError.\\n3. Initialize an empty result list.\\n4. Check if the input list is already sorted. If yes, return the input list.\\n5. Sort the input list in ascending order using the merge sort algorithm.\\n6. Set the start and end indices to 0 and length-1 respectively.\\n7. Loop through the sorted list until the start index is less than or equal to the end index.\\n8. Append the value at the start index to the result list and increment the start index.\\n9. If the start index is less than or equal to the end index, append the value at the end index to the result list and decrement the end index.\\n10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 until the start index is greater than the end index.\\n11. Return the result list.\\n\\nThis design includes error handling for cases where the input list is not of the correct type or if it contains elements that cannot be sorted. The algorithm is also optimized by checking if the input list is already sorted before proceeding with the merge sort algorithm. The time complexity of this algorithm will be O(nlogn) due to the merge sort algorithm. To ensure correct output, we should test the function with edge cases such as an empty list, a list with only one element, and a list with repeated elements. We should also test the function with very large datasets to ensure it can handle large inputs efficiently without crashing. Additionally, we should perform user research to ensure that the user interface design is intuitive and easy-to-use for the sorting operation and test the user interface design with a variety of users to ensure it is accessible to all users. User acceptance testing can provide valuable feedback for improving the sorting operation.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef strange_sort_list(lst):\\n    '''\\n    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.\\n    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,\\n    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.\\n\\n    Examples:\\n    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]\\n    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]\\n    strange_sort_list([]) == []\\n    '''\\n\"}",
