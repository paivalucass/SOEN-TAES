Check if the input is a valid positive integer, if not, raise a ValueError.\n2. Loop through all the numbers from n-1 to 1 and check if the current number evenly divides n.\n3. If the current number evenly divides n, return it as the largest divisor.\n4. If no divisor is found, return None.\n\nHere's the high-level design in pseudocode:\n\n```\ndef largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    # Step 1: Check if the input is a valid positive integer\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input should be a valid positive integer\")\n\n    # Step 2: Loop through all the numbers from n-1 to 1\n    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        # Step 3: Check if the current number evenly divides n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # Step 4: If the current number evenly divides n, return it as the largest divisor\n            return i\n    \n    # Step 4: If no divisor is found, return None\n    return None\n```\n\nThis design allows for efficient finding of the largest divisor of a given number and also handles invalid input cases by raising a ValueError.",
