Each car should have a unique identifier, position, and direction.\n\n2. Generate n cars moving left to right and n cars moving right to left with different starting positions. We can randomly generate the starting positions of the cars, but we need to ensure that there are no collisions at the beginning.\n\n3. Calculate the time for two cars to collide given their positions and directions. We can use the formula: time = (position of car 2 - position of car 1) / (speed of car 1 + speed of car 2). If the time is negative, it means that the two cars have already collided.\n\n4. Iterate through all pairs of cars and calculate the collision time. If the time is positive and less than infinity, it means that the two cars will collide. We can count the number of collisions and return it as the output.\n\n5. We can enhance the functionality of the car race game by allowing players to customize their cars. To achieve this, we can add attributes to the car data structure such as color, speed, acceleration, and handling. We can use object-oriented programming principles to encapsulate the car attributes and behavior. We can also provide a user interface for players to interact with the game and customize their cars.\n\nOverall, the design should prioritize the efficient calculation of collision times and the scalability of the code for a large number of cars.

By allowing players to customize their cars, the game can offer a unique and personalized experience for each player.\\\",\\n    \\\"Note\\\": \\\"It is suggested to consider the feasibility of incorporating the customization feature into the initial design of the game to optimize the code for customization from the beginning. The potential impact of customization on game performance should also be considered. Thorough testing of the customization feature should be done to ensure that it is user-friendly and does not introduce any bugs or glitches into the game. Additionally, incorporating user feedback during the testing phase can help to identify areas of improvement for the customization feature. The development of the core collision detection algorithm should be prioritized, but once that is complete, the addition of the customization feature would be a valuable enhancement.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Create test cases for different scenarios to ensure the function works correctly.', 'Agree with creating test cases to cover all possible scenarios for accurate functioning of the function.']\\n# Design:\\nNew Design:\\n\\nTo implement the car race collision function, we can follow the suggestions provided by our colleague. The following steps can be taken to enhance the functionality of the car race game:\\n\\n1. Define a Car class to represent the car data structure, which includes the unique identifier, position, and direction. We can add attributes to the Car class such as color, speed, acceleration, and handling.\\n\\n2. Use a data structure such as a list to store the cars and their attributes. We can generate n cars moving left to right and n cars moving right to left with different starting positions by implementing a function in the Car class.\\n\\n3. Implement a function in the Car class to randomly generate the starting positions of the cars, ensuring that there are no collisions at the beginning. To test this, we can write a unit test function.\\n\\n4. Use a nested loop to iterate through all pairs of cars and calculate the collision time using the formula: time = (position of car 2 - position of car 1) / (speed of car 1 + speed of car 2). If the time is negative, it means that the two cars have already collided. We can count the number of collisions and return it as the output.\\n\\n5. Consider using multithreading or parallel processing to improve the scalability of the code for a large number of cars. We can also test the scalability of the code by generating a large number of cars and measuring the execution time.\\n\\n6. To enhance the user experience of the game, we can provide a user interface for players to interact with the game and customize their cars. This can be achieved by incorporating user feedback throughout the development process. We can also test the user interface for the customization of cars to ensure that it is user-friendly and does not impact game performance negatively.\\n\\nOverall, this new design prioritizes the efficient calculation of collision times, scalability of the code for a large number of cars, and user experience of the game. Thorough testing and user feedback should be incorporated throughout the development process to ensure that the game is user-friendly and bug-free.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef car_race_collision(n: int):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.\\n    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars\\n    are driving right to left.
