Performance and potential errors with unexpected input should also be tested. Additionally, automated tests should be created to ensure continued functionality with future updates.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Add test cases for numbers, special characters, and empty strings']\\n# Design:\\nBased on the suggestions provided by the developer and tester, I propose the following changes to the existing design:\\n\\n1. Caching Mechanism: To improve the performance of the algorithm, we will add a caching mechanism to store the results of the algorithm for frequently used input strings. This will reduce the number of times the algorithm needs to run on the same input, thus improving the performance.\\n\\n2. Documentation and Examples: To make it easier for other developers to understand and use the code, we will provide documentation and examples for the different regex patterns used in the algorithm. This will also ensure that the code is maintainable in the long term.\\n\\n3. Additional Test Cases: To ensure that the feature works as expected, we will add more edge cases to the unit tests, such as input strings with mixed languages or special characters. We will also add negative tests to ensure that the function fails gracefully when given unexpected input, such as None or a non-string input. Additionally, we will perform a stress test with a very large input string to ensure that the algorithm can handle large inputs without crashing or causing performance issues.\\n\\nFunction Signature:\\n\\ndef remove_consonants(text: str) -> str:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    remove_consonants is a function that takes a string and returns a string without consonants.\\n    :param text: The input string containing consonants to be removed\\n    :type text: str\\n    :return: The input string without consonants\\n    :rtype: str\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    \\nDesign:\\n\\nThe design pattern to be used for this feature is the Strategy pattern, which allows us to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. In this case, we will have a family of algorithms to remove consonants from a string using different regex patterns. The developer can then choose which algorithm to use for a given input string based on its language or character set.\\n\\nTo optimize performance and memory usage, we will use regex patterns that are optimized for large input strings. We will also use lazy quantifiers to reduce memory usage.\\n\\nTo handle edge cases such as non-English or special characters, we will use Unicode character properties in the regex patterns. This will ensure that all types of characters are handled correctly.\\n\\nTo ensure accurate removal of consonants without affecting other characters or formatting, we will use lookahead and lookbehind assertions in the regex patterns. This will ensure that only consonants are removed, and that the remaining characters maintain their original positions and formatting.\\n\\nTo test the feature thoroughly, we will create unit tests that cover different input scenarios, including edge cases and unexpected input. We will also create automated tests that will run with each update to ensure continued functionality.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef remove_vowels(text):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    remove_vowels is a function that takes string and returns string without vowels.\\n    >>> remove_vowels('')\\n    ''\\n    >>> remove_vowels(\\\"abcdef\\\\nghijklm\\\")\\n    'bcdf\\\\nghjklm'\\n    >>> remove_vowels('abcdef')\\n    'bcdf'\\n    >>> remove_vowels('aaaaa')\\n    ''\\n    >>> remove_vowels('aaBAA')\\n    'B'\\n    >>> remove_vowels('zbcd')\\n    'zbcd'\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
