This can be achieved by breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and implementing them as separate functions.\n\nThe function should first check if the input value is within the accepted range of input values (-2^31 to 2^31-1). If the input value is outside this range, the function should return False.\n\nNext, the function should check if the input value is a cube of some integer number.
