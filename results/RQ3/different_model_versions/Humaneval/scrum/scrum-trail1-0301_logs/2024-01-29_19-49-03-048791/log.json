The architecture of the system should be designed to handle the critical features included in the roadmap, and also be flexible enough to accommodate changes due to changing market demands or user needs. The identified features should be properly tested at every stage of development by a dedicated team of testers who work closely with the development team to ensure that issues are identified and resolved in a timely manner in different environments.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Add more test cases to cover edge cases and error scenarios']\\n# Design:\\nNew Design:\\n\\nTo optimize the time complexity of the function how_many_times(), we can use a sliding window approach. We can initialize two pointers, one at the start of the string and the other at the end of the substring. We move the substring pointer till we find a match for the first character of the substring in the string. Once we find a match, we compare the remaining characters of the substring with the next characters in the string. If all the characters of the substring match with the characters in the string, we increment the count and move the substring pointer to the next character. We continue this process till we reach the end of the string.\\n\\nTo ensure the correctness of the implementation, we should provide some sample inputs and outputs for the function. Also, adding some error handling mechanisms would be useful to handle edge cases and potential errors.\\n\\nBased on these suggestions, we can guide the developer to implement the following steps:\\n\\n1. Initialize a count variable to 0.\\n2. Initialize two pointers, i and j, to 0 and 0 respectively.\\n3. While j is less than the length of the string:\\n    a. If the first character of the substring matches the current character of the string:\\n        i. Initialize a variable, k, to j.\\n        ii. While k is less than the length of the string and j-i is less than the length of the substring:\\n            1. If the current character of the string does not match the corresponding character of the substring, break out of the loop.\\n            2. Otherwise, increment k and j.\\n        iii. If j-i is equal to the length of the substring, increment the count and move the i pointer to the next character.\\n    b. Increment the j pointer to the next character.\\n4. Return the count variable.\\n\\nIn addition, it would be helpful to test the function with various inputs to ensure that it provides accurate results. Also, adding some boundary tests would be useful to test the edge cases and ensure that the function behaves correctly in such scenarios.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
