    "DesignDraft0": "Design:\n\nTo implement the `truncate_number` function, we can follow the UserStory and create a modular and scalable architecture that aligns with the needs and preferences of the target market. We can break down the problem into smaller components and design a modular solution that handles a specific task and integrates them together.\n\nOne approach could be to create a separate module for handling the truncation of the floating point number. This module can expose a single function, `truncate_number`, that takes a positive floating point number as input and returns its decimal part.\n\nThe `truncate_number` function can be implemented by first decomposing the input number into an integer part and a decimal part. We can use the built-in `math.floor` function to get the largest integer smaller than the input number, which gives us the integer part. The decimal part can be obtained by subtracting the integer part from the input number. Finally, we can return the decimal part of the number.\n\nHere is a high-level code snippet that illustrates the design:\n\n```\n# Define a separate module for handling truncation of floating point numbers\ndef truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\"\n    integer_part = math.floor(number)\n    decimal_part = number - integer_part\n    return decimal_part\n```\n\nThis approach allows us to create a modular and scalable architecture for the product, as we can easily integrate the `truncate_number` function into the overall system. It also makes it easy to maintain and update the functionality if needed. Additionally, we can conduct thorough testing of the `truncate_number` function to ensure that it works as expected for different scenarios and use cases, following the suggestions provided by the tester in the UserStory.",
    "DesignMeetings0": "{\n    \"Developer\": \"The design looks good overall. However, I suggest adding type annotations to the arguments of the `truncate_number` function to improve its readability and maintainability. Also, it would be helpful to add some error handling to ensure that the input number is positive.\",\n    \"Tester\": \"The design seems solid, but I suggest adding some edge cases to the testing plan to ensure that the function works correctly in all scenarios. For example, we should test with very large and very small numbers to see if the function can handle them properly. We should also test with negative numbers and zero to make sure that the function returns the expected output.\" \n}",
    "Design0": "Based on the suggestions provided by the developer and tester, I have made the following adjustments to the design:\n\nTo improve the readability and maintainability of the `truncate_number` function, I have added type annotations to its arguments. The input number is now explicitly defined as a positive floating point number.\n\nFurthermore, I have implemented error handling to ensure that the input number is positive. If the input number is negative, the function will raise a `ValueError` with a descriptive error message.\n\nTo test the function more thoroughly, I have added edge cases to the testing plan. These include testing with very large and very small numbers, as well as negative numbers and zero. These tests will help to ensure that the function can handle all scenarios and returns the expected output.\n\nHere is the updated code for the `truncate_number` function:\n\n```\nimport math\n\ndef truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\n\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\n\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\"\n    if number <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive number\")\n    \n    integer_part = math.floor(number)\n    decimal_part = number - integer_part\n    return decimal_part\n```\n\nI believe these changes will improve the functionality and reliability of the `truncate_number` function, and make it easier to maintain and update in the future.",

The input number is now explicitly defined as a positive floating point number.\\n\\nFurthermore, I have implemented error handling to ensure that the input number is positive. If the input number is negative, the function will raise a `ValueError` with a descriptive error message.\\n\\nTo test the function more thoroughly, I have added edge cases to the testing plan. These include testing with very large and very small numbers, as well as negative numbers and zero. These tests will help to ensure that the function can handle all scenarios and returns the expected output.\\n\\nHere is the updated code for the `truncate_number` function:\\n\\n```\\nimport math\\n\\ndef truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\\n\\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\\n\\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\\n    0.5\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    if number <= 0:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Input must be a positive number\\\")\\n    \\n    integer_part = math.floor(number)\\n    decimal_part = number - integer_part\\n    return decimal_part\\n```\\n\\nI believe these changes will improve the functionality and reliability of the `truncate_number` function, and make it easier to maintain and update in the future.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into\\n    and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals\\n    (leftover part always smaller than 1).\\n\\n    Return the decimal part of the number.\\n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\\n    0.5\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
