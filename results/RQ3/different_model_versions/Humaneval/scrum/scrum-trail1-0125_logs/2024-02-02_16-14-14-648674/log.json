Instead of using a list of boolean values to store whether a number is prime or not, I will use a list of integers where the index represents the number and the value represents the smallest prime factor. This will help optimize memory usage.\\n\\n2. I will test the `is_prime` function with various input values, including prime and non-prime numbers, to ensure it correctly identifies prime numbers. Additionally, I will check the performance of the function for large input numbers to see if it efficiently determines primality.\\n\\n3. I will implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm in the `is_prime` function. This algorithm works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2, which eliminates non-prime numbers. By the end of the algorithm, the remaining unmarked numbers will be prime.\\n\\n4. I will create a list of boolean values, where the index represents the number and the value indicates whether it is prime or not.\\n\\n5. I will initialize all values in the list to `True`.\\n\\n6. I will iterate through the list starting from 2 (the first prime number) up to the square root of the input number `n`.\\n\\n7. For each prime number found, I will mark all its multiples as `False` in the list.\\n\\n8. After the iteration, I will check if the input number `n` is prime by looking at the value in the list at index `n`.\\n\\n9. I will return `True` if the value is `True`, indicating `n` is prime, and `False` otherwise.\\n\\nThis updated design incorporates the suggestions provided by my colleagues and outlines the key steps involved in efficiently checking for prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef is_prime(n):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.\\n    >>> is_prime(6)\\n    False\\n    >>> is_prime(101)\\n    True\\n    >>> is_prime(11)\\n    True\\n    >>> is_prime(13441)\\n    True\\n    >>> is_prime(61)\\n    True\\n    >>> is_prime(4)\\n    False\\n    >>> is_prime(1)\\n    False\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
