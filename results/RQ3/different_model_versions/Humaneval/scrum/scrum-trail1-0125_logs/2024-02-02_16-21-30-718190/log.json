Utilize a function named `encode` that takes a string message as input.\n2. Iterate over each character in the message to process them individually.\n3. Check if the character is a letter.\n4. If the character is a letter, swap its case.\n5. If the character is a vowel, replace it with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the English alphabet.\n6. Return the encoded message after processing all characters.\n\nBy following this design, the developer can efficiently implement the `encode` function to achieve the desired functionality of encoding messages as per the given requirements.
