The function is converting the input values to float and replacing commas with periods, which resulted in a different output than expected.\n\nRecommendation: Review the implementation of the compare_one function to ensure correct conversion and comparison logic.\n\nNote: Please make the necessary adjustments to the code to pass the test.# suggestions:\n{\"product-owner\": [\"Prioritize the review and adjustment of the compare_one function to ensure correct conversion and comparison logic in order to pass the test.\"], \"architect\": [\"Review the implementation of the compare_one function to ensure correct conversion and comparison logic in order to pass the test.\"], \"developer\": [\"Review the implementation of the compare_one function to ensure correct conversion and comparison logic to pass the test.\"], \"tester\": [\"Review the implementation of the compare_one function to ensure correct conversion and comparison logic to pass the test.\"]}",
