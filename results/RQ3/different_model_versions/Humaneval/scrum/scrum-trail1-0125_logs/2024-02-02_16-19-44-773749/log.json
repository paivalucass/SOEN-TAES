Define a function named `is_happy` that takes a string `s` as input.\\n2. Add input validation to handle edge cases like empty strings or strings with less than 3 characters. If the length of the input string is not at least 3, return False.\\n3. Break down the algorithm into smaller functions for better code organization and reusability.\\n4. Add comments to explain the purpose of each step in the function.\\n5. Write unit tests to ensure the function works as expected.\\n6. Iterate over the input string in chunks of 3 consecutive characters.\\n7. For each chunk, check if all characters are distinct. If not, return False.\\n8. Test the function with various input strings including edge cases to verify its robustness.\\n9. Check if the function provides the correct output for happy and unhappy strings.\\n10. Validate the clarity of the feedback provided to the user.\\n11. Perform boundary testing to ensure the function handles different string lengths appropriately.\\n12. If all chunks pass the distinct characters check, return True.\\n13. Provide clear and concise feedback to the user on whether the input string is happy or not.\\n14. Prioritize user experience by ensuring that the feedback is easy to understand and aligns with the criteria of having 3 consecutive distinct characters.\\n\\nThis revised design incorporates input validation, code organization, comments, unit tests, testing, and user feedback considerations to improve the overall quality and robustness of the function.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef is_happy(s):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"You are given a string s.\\n    Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.\\n    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct\\n    For example:\\n    is_happy(a) => False\\n    is_happy(aa) => False\\n    is_happy(abcd) => True\\n    is_happy(aabb) => False\\n    is_happy(adb) => True\\n    is_happy(xyy) => False\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
