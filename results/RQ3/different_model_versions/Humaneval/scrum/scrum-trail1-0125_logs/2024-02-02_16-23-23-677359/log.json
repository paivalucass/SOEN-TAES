I will handle edge cases like empty arrays appropriately.\\n\\n2. **Function Decomposition:**\\n   - I will break down the count_nums function into smaller, more modular functions as suggested. I will create separate functions to extract signed digits, calculate the sum of digits, and count elements with sum of digits greater than 0 to improve maintainability and testability.\\n\\n3. **Error Handling:**\\n   - I will implement error handling to address edge cases like empty arrays or arrays with non-integer values.\\n\\n4. **Testing Strategy:**\\n   - I will develop test cases covering each acceptance criterion mentioned in the User Story. I will include edge cases such as empty arrays, arrays with only negative numbers, and arrays with mixed integers.
