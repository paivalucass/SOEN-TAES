Create a mapping of characters to their ASCII codes.\\n4. Add input validation to check if the input string 's' is not empty or null. If it is, return an error message.\\n5. Add error handling for cases where the input string does not contain any uppercase characters. Return an error message in such cases.\\n6. Optimize the mapping of characters to their ASCII codes for better performance.\\n7. Iterate through each character in the input string 's'.\\n8. Check if the character is an uppercase letter using the mapping.\\n9. If the character is uppercase, add its ASCII code to the 'sum'.\\n10. Test the function with empty input string, null input string, and input strings with no uppercase characters as suggested by the tester.\\n11. Test the function with input strings containing both uppercase and lowercase characters.\\n12. Test the function with long input strings to check for performance issues.\\n\\nThis updated design incorporates input validation, error handling, optimization for better performance, and testing scenarios recommended by both the developer and tester.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef digitSum(s):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Task\\n    Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the upper characters only'\\n    ASCII codes.\\n\\n    Examples:\\n        digitSum(\\\"\\\") => 0\\n        digitSum(\\\"abAB\\\") => 131\\n        digitSum(\\\"abcCd\\\") => 67\\n        digitSum(\\\"helloE\\\") => 69\\n        digitSum(\\\"woArBld\\\") => 131\\n        digitSum(\\\"aAaaaXa\\\") => 153\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
