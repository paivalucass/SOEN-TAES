Create a function called words_in_sentence(sentence) that takes a string representing a sentence as input.\\n2. Implement a separate function called is_prime(number) to check if a number is prime for better code readability and reusability.\\n3. Consider adding error handling to handle cases where the input sentence is empty or null.\\n4. Add unit tests to ensure the function works as expected in different scenarios, including empty sentences and sentences with special characters.\\n5. The function will return a string containing the words from the original sentence whose lengths are prime numbers.\\n6. Maintain the order of the words in the new string to be the same as the original sentence.\\n7. Implement a mechanism to identify prime numbers for word lengths.\\n8. Iterate over each word in the sentence, calculate its length, and check if it is a prime number.\\n9. If the length of a word is a prime number, add it to the output string.\\n10. Ensure the function handles sentences with constraints such as length limits and only containing letters.\\n\\nPlease let me know if any further adjustments are needed.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef words_in_sentence(sentence):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    You are given a string representing a sentence,\\n    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,\\n    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,\\n    whose lengths are prime numbers,\\n    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.\\n\\n    Example 1:\\n        Input: sentence = \\\"This is a test\\\"\\n        Output: \\\"is\\\"\\n\\n    Example 2:\\n        Input: sentence = \\\"lets go for swimming\\\"\\n        Output: \\\"go for\\\"\\n\\n    Constraints:\\n        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100\\n        * sentence contains only letters\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
