Define a function `even_odd_palindrome(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a tuple containing the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the range (1, n), inclusive.\\n\\n2. Create a helper function `is_palindrome(num)` to check if a number is a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing it with its reversed version. This will improve code readability.\\n\\n3. Iterate through the range from 1 to n and for each number:\\n   - Check if the number is a palindrome using the helper function `is_palindrome`.\\n   - Check if the palindrome number is even or odd.\\n   - Count the number of even and odd palindromes separately. Add comments to explain the logic behind counting even and odd palindromes.\\n\\n4. Return a tuple containing the count of even and odd palindromes.\\n\\nExample:\\n- Input: 3\\n  Output: (1, 2)\\n  Explanation: Palindromes within the range 1 to 3 are 1, 2, 3. One is even and two are odd.\\n\\n- Input: 12\\n  Output: (4, 6)\\n  Explanation: Palindromes within the range 1 to 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. Four are even and six are odd.\\n\\n5. Constraints:\\n   - 1 <= n <= 10^3\\n   - The returned tuple contains the count of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.\\n\\nI believe these updates will enhance the functionality and readability of the design.
