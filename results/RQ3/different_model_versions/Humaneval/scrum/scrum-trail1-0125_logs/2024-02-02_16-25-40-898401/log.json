This will enhance the readability and maintainability of the code, making it easier to understand and modify in the future. Thorough testing of the regular expressions with various types of input is essential to ensure they handle all possible scenarios and edge cases accurately.\\n\\n2. Enhance testing of the split_words function with diverse inputs:\\n   - It is crucial to test the split_words function with a wide range of inputs, including different combinations of whitespace, commas, and special characters, to validate the accuracy and robustness of the regular expressions in identifying and splitting the words correctly. Testing with edge cases, such as empty input or unusual characters, will help verify the function's ability to handle various scenarios effectively.\\n\\nBy incorporating named capturing groups in regular expressions and enhancing the testing of the split_words function, the code will be more reliable, maintainable, and capable of handling different input scenarios accurately. This design approach ensures that the developer writes code that meets the requirements outlined in the user story and delivers the desired output format as specified in the acceptance criteria.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef split_words(txt):\\n    '''\\n    Given a string of words, return a list of words split on whitespace, if no whitespaces exists in the text you\\n    should split on commas ',' if no commas exists you should return the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the\\n    alphabet, ord('a') = 0, ord('b') = 1, ... ord('z') = 25\\n    Examples\\n    split_words(\\\"Hello world!\\\") \\u279e [\\\"Hello\\\", \\\"world!\\\"]\\n    split_words(\\\"Hello,world!\\\") \\u279e [\\\"Hello\\\", \\\"world!\\\"]\\n    split_words(\\\"abcdef\\\") == 3 \\n    '''\\n\"}",
