Instructions:\\n   - Clear instructions on how to use the interface and input the array and value of `k` have been included.\\n   - Guidance on what the user should expect as the output of the function is provided.\\n   - The instructions are concise and easy to understand.\\n\\nBy following these design guidelines, the developer can create a user-friendly interface for the `add_elements` function that prioritizes user experience and simplifies the process of inputting the array and value of `k.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef add_elements(arr, k):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Given a non-empty array of integers arr and an integer k, return\\n    the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.\\n\\n    Example:\\n\\n        Input: arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], k = 4\\n        Output: 24 # sum of 21 + 3\\n\\n    Constraints:\\n        1. 1 <= len(arr) <= 100\\n        2. 1 <= k <= len(arr)\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
