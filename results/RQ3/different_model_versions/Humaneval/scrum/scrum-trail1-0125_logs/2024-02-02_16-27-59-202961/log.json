It also increases the maximum length of the file name to 255 characters, providing more flexibility and accommodating different naming conventions.\\n\\nDevelopers can utilize this enhanced regular expression pattern in their code to ensure comprehensive validation of file names, covering various scenarios such as special characters, spaces, and different file name lengths.
