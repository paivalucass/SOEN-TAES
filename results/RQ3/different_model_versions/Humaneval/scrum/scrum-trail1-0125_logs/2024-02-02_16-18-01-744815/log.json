Utilize a bitmask to handle cases where the shift value exceeds the number of digits in x, which can optimize the shifting process effectively.\\n2. Test edge cases where the shift value is 0 or negative, as well as cases where the input x is negative or contains leading zeros, to ensure robustness.\\n3. Use bitwise operations like bitwise left shift (<<) and bitwise OR (|) to efficiently shift digits in the integer x by the specified shift value.\\n4. Consider reversing the digits in x when the shift value exceeds the number of digits to handle edge cases efficiently.\\n5. Return the result of the circular shift operation as a string to maintain consistency with the expected output format of the function.\\n6. Add additional test cases to cover various scenarios and validate the functionality and robustness of the circular_shift function.\\n\\nBy incorporating these improvements, the developer can create a more optimized and efficient implementation of the circular_shift function while leveraging bitwise operations for digit shifting. The added test cases will help ensure the function behaves as expected in different scenarios.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef circular_shift(x, shift):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Circular shift the digits of the integer x, shift the digits right by shift\\n    and return the result as a string.\\n    If shift > number of digits, return digits reversed.\\n    >>> circular_shift(12, 1)\\n    \\\"21\\\"\\n    >>> circular_shift(12, 2)\\n    \\\"12\\\"\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
