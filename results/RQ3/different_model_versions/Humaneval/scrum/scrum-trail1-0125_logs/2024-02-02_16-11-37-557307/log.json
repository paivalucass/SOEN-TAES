One possible high-level design could involve iterating through the list of integers and keeping track of the current maximum element seen so far.

Initialize an empty list to store the rolling maximum elements.\n2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current maximum element seen so far.\n3. Iterate through the input list of integers.\n4. For each element, compare it with the current maximum element.\n5. If the element is greater than the current maximum, update the current maximum.\n6. Append the current maximum to the list of rolling maximum elements.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until all elements in the input list have been processed.\n8.

Deques allow for efficient O(1) insertions and deletions at both ends, which can significantly improve the overall performance of the algorithm.\\n\\nHere is the updated approach:\\n\\n1. Initialize an empty deque to store the rolling maximum elements.\\n2. Iterate through the input list of integers.\\n3. For each element, compare it with the element at the back of the deque.\\n4. If the element is greater than the element at the back of the deque, remove the element at the back of the deque.\\n5. Repeat step 4 until the element at the back of the deque is greater than the current element, then append the current element to the deque.\\n6. Return the deque as the list of rolling maximum elements.\\n\\nThis optimized approach using a deque data structure will improve the efficiency of the rolling_max function and provide a better user experience for the product owner's clean and intuitive user interface design.\", \"Question\": \"from typing import List, Tuple\\n\\n\\ndef rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment\\n    in the sequence.\\n    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])\\n    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
