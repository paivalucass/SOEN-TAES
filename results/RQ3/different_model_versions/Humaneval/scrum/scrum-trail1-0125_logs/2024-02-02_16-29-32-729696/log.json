It should ignore negative numbers and non-integers. If the input list is empty, the function should return 0.\n\n### Design Considerations:\n1. Utilize list comprehension to filter out negative and non-integer numbers.\n2. Calculate the sum of squares of odd numbers.\n3. Double the sum of squares result if odd numbers are present.\n4. Handle edge case of an empty input list by returning 0.\n\n### High-Level Design:\n```python\ndef double_the_difference(lst):\n    # Filter out negative and non-integer numbers using list comprehension\n    filtered_lst = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int) and x > 0]\n\n    # Calculate the sum of squares of odd numbers\n    odd_squares_sum = sum([x**2 for x in filtered_lst if x % 2 != 0])\n\n    # Double the sum of squares result\n    result = odd_squares_sum * 2 if odd_squares_sum > 0 else 0\n\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function first filters out negative and non-integer numbers using list comprehension.\n- It then calculates the sum of squares of odd numbers by iterating through the filtered list and squaring the odd values.\n- The sum of squares result is doubled if it is greater than 0.\n- Finally, the result is returned.",
