Input: The function should take a dictionary as input.\\n2. Output: The function should return True if all keys are strings in lower case or upper case, and False otherwise.\\n3. Special Case: The function should return False if the given dictionary is empty or if it contains non-string keys.\\n4. Error Handling: Add error handling to check for cases where the input dictionary contains non-string keys.\\n5. Test Cases: Create test cases with different types of input dictionaries, including empty dictionaries, dictionaries with mixed case keys, and dictionaries with non-string keys to ensure the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.\\n6. Logic:\\n   - Initialize two variables to keep track of the count of upper case keys and lower case keys.\\n   - Iterate through the keys of the dictionary and check if each key is either all in lower case or all in upper case.\\n   - If any key is mixed case or if the dictionary is empty or contains non-string keys, return False.\\n   - Otherwise, return True.\\n\\nBy following this revised design, the developer can efficiently implement the validation function to check the case of keys in a dictionary. The addition of error handling and test cases will help prevent unexpected behavior and improve the robustness of the function.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef check_dict_case(dict):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Given a dictionary, return True if all keys are strings in lower \\n    case or all keys are strings in upper case, else return False.\\n    The function should return False is the given dictionary is empty.\\n    Examples:\\n    check_dict_case({\\\"a\\\":\\\"apple\\\", \\\"b\\\":\\\"banana\\\"}) should return True.\\n    check_dict_case({\\\"a\\\":\\\"apple\\\", \\\"A\\\":\\\"banana\\\", \\\"B\\\":\\\"banana\\\"}) should return False.\\n    check_dict_case({\\\"a\\\":\\\"apple\\\", 8:\\\"banana\\\", \\\"a\\\":\\\"apple\\\"}) should return False.\\n    check_dict_case({\\\"Name\\\":\\\"John\\\", \\\"Age\\\":\\\"36\\\", \\\"City\\\":\\\"Houston\\\"}) should return False.\\n    check_dict_case({\\\"STATE\\\":\\\"NC\\\", \\\"ZIP\\\":\\\"12345\\\" }) should return True.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
