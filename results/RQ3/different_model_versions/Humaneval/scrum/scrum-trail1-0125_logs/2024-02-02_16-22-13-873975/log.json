Error handling:\\n   - Implement error handling for cases where the input string `s` is empty.\\n   - Provide clear error messages to the user indicating the reason for the error and how to resolve it.\\n\\n3. Count uppercase vowels in even indices:\\n   - Consider using a more efficient method than regular expressions to count uppercase vowels in even indices, such as iterating through the string and checking each character.\\n\\n4. Test cases:\\n   - Add more comprehensive test cases to cover edge cases and potential bugs that may not be immediately obvious.\\n   - Test the function with different types of input, such as strings with varying lengths and content to ensure it behaves as expected in all scenarios.\\n\\n5. Documentation:\\n   - Verify that the documentation is clear, accurate, and includes all necessary information for users to understand and use the function effectively.\\n   - Provide clear documentation for the function `count_upper` explaining its purpose and usage. Include examples to illustrate how the function works with different inputs.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef count_upper(s):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.\\n    \\n    For example:\\n    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1\\n    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0\\n    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
