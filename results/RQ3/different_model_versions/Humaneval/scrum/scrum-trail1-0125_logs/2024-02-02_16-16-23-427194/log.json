Description: The function checks if all numbers in the input list are below the specified threshold value. It returns True if all numbers are below the threshold, otherwise False.\\n5. Input Validation:\\n   - Ensure that the input list (numbers_list) is a valid list data type.\\n   - Ensure that the threshold value (threshold) is a valid integer data type.\\n6. Edge Cases to Consider:\\n   - An empty list should return True since there are no numbers to check.\\n   - Non-integer values in the list will be skipped during comparison.\\n7. Scalability and Efficiency:\\n   - The algorithm is optimized for large lists to ensure efficient performance.\\n   - The function uses appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient comparison.\\n8. Performance Optimization:\\n   - The function minimizes unnecessary iterations over the list.\\n   - Built-in functions and libraries are utilized for optimized performance.\\n9. Constraints:\\n   - The function is designed with clear specifications and examples for developers.\\n   - It effectively handles various scenarios and edge cases.\\n10. Testing:\\n   - Test cases are written to validate the functionality of the function, covering both positive and negative cases.\\n   - Automated testing tools can be used to streamline the testing process.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef below_threshold(l: list, t: int):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t.\\n    >>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)\\n    True\\n    >>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)\\n    False\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
