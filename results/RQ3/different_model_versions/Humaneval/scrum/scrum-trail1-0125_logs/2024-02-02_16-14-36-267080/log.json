Implement a divide and conquer approach to reduce the number of comparisons needed to find the maximum element. This will involve recursively dividing the dataset and comparing the maximum elements of the sub-arrays.\\n\\n2. Utilize a binary search algorithm to efficiently locate the maximum element in a sorted list. This will improve the function's scalability and performance.\\n\\n3. Consider using data structures like heaps or trees to store elements in a way that allows for efficient retrieval of the maximum element. This will further enhance the function's efficiency.\\n\\n4. Ensure thorough testing with large datasets to verify the function's scalability and performance. Test different scenarios, including sorted and unsorted lists, to validate the function's efficiency and accuracy.\\n\\nBy incorporating these design considerations, the max_element function will be well-suited for handling large datasets with optimal performance and efficiency.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef max_element(l: list):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Return maximum element in the list.\\n    >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])\\n    3\\n    >>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])\\n    123\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
