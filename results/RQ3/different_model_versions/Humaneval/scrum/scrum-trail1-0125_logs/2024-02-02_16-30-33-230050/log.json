Output of the function:\\n   - The function should return a string which is the result of reversing the case of letters and reversing the entire string if it contains no letters.\\n\\n3. Steps to implement the function:\\n   - Utilize built-in functions in Python such as `isalpha()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, and `[::1]` for efficient string manipulation.\\n   - Iterate through each character in the input string `s`.\\n   - Check if the character is a letter. If it is a letter, reverse its case (from lower to upper or vice versa).\\n   - If the string contains no letters, reverse the entire string.\\n   - Return the resulted string.\\n\\n4.
