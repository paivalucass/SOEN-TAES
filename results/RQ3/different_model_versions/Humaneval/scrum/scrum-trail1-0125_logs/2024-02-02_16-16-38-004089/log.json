Define the input and output requirements:\\n   - Input: Two strings, s0 and s1.\\n   - Output: Boolean value indicating whether the two strings have the same characters.\\n\\n2. Implement the logic to compare characters in the `same_chars` function:\\n   - Utilize built-in functions like collections.Counter to create character frequency dictionaries for both strings.\\n   - Implement error handling for cases where the input strings are not valid (e.g. not strings or empty strings).\\n   - Compare the character frequency dictionaries to check if they are equal.\\n\\n3. Write test cases to validate the functionality:\\n   - Test cases should cover all possible scenarios mentioned in the design document.\\n   - Include boundary value analysis to test the function with inputs at the lower and upper limits.\\n   - Ensure comprehensive test cases cover different scenarios such as comparing words with different lengths, handling special characters, handling empty strings, and testing edge cases.\\n\\n4. Create a design document outlining the approach for implementing the functionality:\\n   - Describe the steps involved in creating the character frequency dictionary using collections.Counter.\\n   - Explain the process of comparing the character frequency dictionaries efficiently.\\n   - Discuss the importance of comprehensive test cases, error handling, and integration testing.\\n\\n5. Perform integration testing to validate the functionality when integrated with other components:\\n   - Verify that the `same_chars` function works correctly when integrated with other parts of the system.\\n   - Ensure that integration testing covers all possible interactions with other components in the system.\\n\\nThank you for your suggestions, I have incorporated them into the revised design.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Check if two words have the same characters.\\n    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')\\n    True\\n    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')\\n    True\\n    >>> same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')\\n    True\\n    >>> same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')\\n    False\\n    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')\\n    False\\n    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')\\n    False\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
