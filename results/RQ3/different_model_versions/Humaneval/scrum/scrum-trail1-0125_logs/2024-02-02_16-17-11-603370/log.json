The design should consider the efficiency of the algorithm and the appropriate data structures for storing and manipulating prime factors.\n\n1. Algorithm Design:\n- Start by initially dividing the given number by the smallest prime number (2) and continue dividing until the number is no longer divisible by that prime number.\n- Move on to the next prime number and repeat the division process until the number is fully factorized.\n- Keep track of the largest prime factor found during the process.\n\n2. Data Structure:\n- Consider using a list or set to store the prime factors found during the factorization process.\n- Implement a function to efficiently check if a number is prime to aid in the factorization process.\n\n3. Error Handling:\n- Ensure proper input validation to handle cases where the input number is less than or equal to 1 or is a prime number.\n- Provide clear error messages and feedback to the user in case of invalid input.\n\n4. Testing:\n- Thoroughly test the largest_prime_factor function with different input scenarios, edge cases, and error handling to ensure its correctness and user-friendliness.\n- Conduct performance testing to verify the efficiency of the algorithm in identifying the largest prime factor.\n\nBy following this design approach, the developer can create a user-friendly interface for the largest_prime_factor function that enhances the overall user experience and delivers accurate results.",
