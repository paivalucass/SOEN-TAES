Input Validation Module: This module will contain a function that takes in the input and checks if it is a valid hexadecimal number. The function will be reusable in other parts of the code.\\n\\n2. Prime Digit Counting Module: This module will have a function that takes the validated input and counts the number of prime hexadecimal digits. The function will be designed to be independent and reusable.\\n\\n3. Error Handling Module: This module will consist of functions to handle edge cases and error scenarios such as empty strings or non-hexadecimal characters. These functions will also be designed to be independent and reusable.\\n\\nIncorporating Test Cases: The design will include the creation of test cases to cover various scenarios and boundary value analysis. This will ensure thorough testing of valid hexadecimal numbers with prime digits, invalid input formats, and edge cases like empty strings or non-hexadecimal characters. Boundary value analysis will also be considered to test all possible combinations.\\n\\nOverall, the new design promotes modular programming and code reusability, in line with the suggestions provided.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef hex_key(num):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"You have been tasked to write a function that receives \\n    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal \\n    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number \\n    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).\\n    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.\\n    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...\\n    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, \\n    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).\\n    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, \\n    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.\\n    Examples:\\n    For num = \\\"AB\\\" the output should be 1.\\n    For num = \\\"1077E\\\" the output should be 2.\\n    For num = \\\"ABED1A33\\\" the output should be 4.\\n    For num = \\\"123456789ABCDEF0\\\" the output should be 6.\\n    For num = \\\"2020\\\" the output should be 2.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
