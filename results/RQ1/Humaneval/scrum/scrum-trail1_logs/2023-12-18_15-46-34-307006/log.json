    "DesignDraft0": "Design Specification:\n\nThe feature of checking whether a list of numbers is sorted in ascending order should be implemented using the following algorithm:\n1. Iterate through the list of numbers and compare each number with the next one to check if they are in ascending order.\n2. If any number is greater than the next one, return False.\n3. If the entire list is iterated without finding any out-of-order numbers, return True.\n\nDependencies:\nThis feature has no specific dependencies and can be implemented using standard Python libraries.\n\nPotential Impact on the Existing System:\nThe implementation of this feature should have minimal impact on the existing system as it does not require external dependencies and only involves processing a list of numbers.\n\nTest Cases:\n- Empty list: []\n- Single element list: [5]\n- List with ascending order: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n- List with descending order: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n- List with out-of-order numbers: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]\n- List with duplicate numbers: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]\n\nScalability and Performance Considerations:\nThe algorithm for checking whether a list of numbers is sorted in ascending order has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list. This algorithm is efficient and suitable for large lists of numbers. Additionally, it does not have any specific scalability or performance requirements as it operates on basic integer values.\n\nArchitecture and Design Patterns:\nThe implementation of this feature can follow the functional programming paradigm, using a simple function to perform the sorting check. The use of functional programming principles can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.\n\nOverall, the architecture and design for this feature should prioritize simplicity, efficiency, and maintainability, while ensuring that it meets the specified requirements and test cases.",
