This will allow users to easily input musical notes and understand the corresponding list of integers representing the beats for each note. To achieve this, a thorough analysis of the user interface requirements will be conducted to ensure clarity and intuitiveness for users. Additionally, interactive features will be incorporated to assist users in inputting musical notes and understanding the corresponding list of integers representing the beats for each note.\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Write test cases for various input strings to ensure the function works as expected']\\n# Design:\\nAs a professional architect, I have considered the suggestions provided by the developer and tester and have revised the design accordingly.\\n\\nDesign:\\n- Define a function parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int] to parse the music string and return a list of integers representing the beats for each note.\\n- Use clear and descriptive variable names within the function to improve code readability and maintainability.\\n- Break down the function into smaller, more manageable parts to improve code readability and maintainability.\\n- Consider adding error handling to account for invalid input.\\n- Use a legend to define the mapping between musical notes and their corresponding beats (e.g., 'o' - whole note, lasts four beats, 'o|' - half note, lasts two beats, '.|' - quarter note, lasts one beat).\\n- The function should take the music string as input and return a list of integers representing the beats for each note.\\n- Provide a clear and concise description within the function docstring explaining the input, output, and how the function works.\\n- Include an example in the docstring to showcase the expected input and output of the function (e.g., parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o') should return [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]).\\n- Ensure the design is high-level and focused on guiding the developer in writing code, rather than providing implementation details.\\n\\nThis revised design takes into account the suggestions provided and aims to improve the code's readability, maintainability, and accuracy in handling various input strings and edge cases.\", \"Question\": \"from typing import List\\n\\n\\ndef parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" Input to this function is a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format.\\n    Your task is to parse this string and return list of integers corresponding to how many beats does each\\n    not last.\\n\\n    Here is a legend:\\n    'o' - whole note, lasts four beats\\n    'o|' - half note, lasts two beats\\n    '.|' - quater note, lasts one beat\\n\\n    >>> parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')\\n    [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
