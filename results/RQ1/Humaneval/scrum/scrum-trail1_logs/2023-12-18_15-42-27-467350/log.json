Both of these sorting algorithms have a time complexity of O(n log n) and can effectively handle large input array sizes.\\n\\nIn addition to the sorting algorithm, input validation should be thoroughly implemented to ensure that the positive integer k is within the range of [1, length of the input array]. This will help in handling various edge cases and ensuring the correctness of the output list.\\n\\nFurthermore, thorough testing of the sorting algorithm implementation is essential to ensure it effectively finds the maximum k numbers in the input array. This should include testing various edge cases for input validation to ensure that the positive integer k is within the specified range.\\n\\nOverall, the design should focus on implementing a high-level sorting algorithm, input validation, and thorough testing to guide the developer in writing code for this requirement.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef maximum(arr, k):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list \\n    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.\\n\\n    Example 1:\\n\\n        Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3\\n        Output: [-4, -3, 5]\\n\\n    Example 2:\\n\\n        Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2\\n        Output: [4, 4]\\n\\n    Example 3:\\n\\n        Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1\\n        Output: [2]\\n\\n    Note:\\n        1.
