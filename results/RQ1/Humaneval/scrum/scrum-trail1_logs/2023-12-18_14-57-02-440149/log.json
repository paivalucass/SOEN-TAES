The function signature is defined with input type annotation for clarity. The function documentation includes an example of how the function should behave with a sample input and output. This design focuses on guiding the developer in writing the code for the rescaling algorithm, without providing specific implementation details. The use of existing libraries or functions for linear transformation can be considered during the implementation phase to optimize the development process.",

Here is the updated design:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import List\\n\\ndef rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Given list of numbers, apply a linear transform to that list,\\n    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1\\n    If the input list has less than two elements, raise a ValueError\\n    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])\\n    [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    if len(numbers) < 2:\\n        raise ValueError(\\\"Input list must have at least two elements\\\")\\n\\n    # Perform linear transformation here\\n\\n    return rescaled_numbers\\n```\\n\\nThank you for the valuable suggestions, and I believe the updated design addresses the concerns raised while maintaining the clarity and functionality of the original design.\", \"Question\": \"from typing import List\\n\\n\\ndef rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,\\n    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1\\n    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])\\n    [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
