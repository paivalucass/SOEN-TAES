It should also handle edge cases such as 0 or negative numbers in the input.\\n- The function should use a mapping of integer values to their corresponding roman numeral symbols.\\n- The function should iterate through the mapping to find the largest roman numeral symbol that is less than or equal to the input integer, subtract its value from the input integer, and append the corresponding symbol to the result string.\\n- The function should continue this process until the input integer becomes 0.\\n- The function should then return the resulting string as the roman numeral equivalent in lowercase.\\n\\nIn addition, test cases should be created to cover the full range of input values from 1 to 1000, as well as edge cases such as 0, negative numbers, and non-integer inputs. The function should be verified to return the correct roman numeral equivalent for each input.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef int_to_mini_roman(number):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,\\n    and return it in lowercase.\\n    Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000\\n\\n    Examples:\\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix'\\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'\\n    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
