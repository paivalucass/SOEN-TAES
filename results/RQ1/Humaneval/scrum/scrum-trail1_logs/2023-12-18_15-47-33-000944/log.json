If the two intervals don't intersect, the function should also return \\\"NO\\\".\\n\\nInput validation and edge cases should be handled separately as per the user story. This includes implementing input validation to check if the intervals are valid (e.g. start <= end), handling edge cases such as empty intervals or negative numbers, and optimizing the algorithm for checking prime numbers.\\n\\nThe Tester should create test cases to cover all possible scenarios, including empty intervals, negative numbers, and boundary values.
