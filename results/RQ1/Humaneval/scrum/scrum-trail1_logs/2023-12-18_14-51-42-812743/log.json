This will help reduce the time complexity of the function and optimize its performance. \\n\\nAs for the make_palindrome function, I have used efficient algorithms to find the longest palindromic prefix of the given string and then appended the remaining characters in reverse order to form the shortest palindrome. Additionally, I have considered using data structures like arrays or linked lists to further optimize the performance of this function. \\n\\nIn terms of testing, I have included test cases with both short and long input strings, as well as input strings with special characters and spaces to ensure the robustness of the is_palindrome function. For the make_palindrome function, I have tested it with various input strings to cover different scenarios, paying special attention to boundary conditions where the input string is already a palindrome or has multiple palindromic prefixes.\\n\\nOverall, the revised design aims to address the suggestions provided and ensure that the is_palindrome and make_palindrome functions are efficient, reliable, and thoroughly tested.\", \"Question\": \"\\n\\ndef is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" Test if given string is a palindrome \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    return string == string[::-1]\\n\\n\\ndef make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.\\n    Algorithm idea is simple:\\n    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.\\n    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.\\n    >>> make_palindrome('')\\n    ''\\n    >>> make_palindrome('cat')\\n    'catac'\\n    >>> make_palindrome('cata')\\n    'catac'\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
