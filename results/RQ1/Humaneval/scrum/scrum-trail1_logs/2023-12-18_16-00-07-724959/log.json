It verifies the correctness of the count of valid triples returned by the function and tests the error handling by passing invalid inputs and checking for appropriate error messages. Additionally, stress testing with large values of n is performed to ensure the function's performance.\\n\\nThis revised design takes into account the suggestions provided and ensures that the function is robust, efficient, and thoroughly tested.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef get_max_triples(n):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    You are given a positive integer n.
