To improve modularity and maintainability, the implementation of the strange_sort_list function will be broken down into smaller, reusable functions. Additionally, algorithms like quicksort or mergesort will be considered for efficient sorting of the input list. Testing of the strange_sort_list function will include various input scenarios such as empty lists, lists with a single element, and large lists to ensure it handles edge cases and performs efficiently. The function will also be tested with duplicate integer values to verify its handling of such cases.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Create test cases for examples and edge cases', 'Ensure function works as expected']\\n# Design:\\nBased on the suggestions, I will revise the design to include specific examples of how the find_min_max function could be implemented and also provide specific examples of test cases for the strange_sort_list function, including edge cases and scenarios with duplicate integer values.\\n\\n```python\\ndef strange_sort_list(lst):\\n    '''\\n    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.\\n    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,\\n    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.\\n\\n    Examples:\\n    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]\\n    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]\\n    strange_sort_list([]) == []\\n\\n    Strategy:\\n    1.
