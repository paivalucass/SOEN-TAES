The test case for the function bf(planet1, planet2) with input 'Earth' and 'Mercury' has produced the output ('Venus',) instead of the expected output ('Venus').\n\nRecommendation:\nThe code for the function bf() needs to be reviewed and corrected to ensure that it produces the expected output for the given input.\n\nNote: The test report has been generated based on the provided test script's output and the analysis of the code."
