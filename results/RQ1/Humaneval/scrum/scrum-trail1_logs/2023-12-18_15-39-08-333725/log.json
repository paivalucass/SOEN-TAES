Lastly, the user story has been updated to reflect the need for a user-friendly interface for the histogram function, allowing users to easily input a string and view the corresponding dictionary of letters with the most repetition and their counts.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Consider edge cases such as empty strings and multiple occurrences of the same letter in the input string']\\n# Design:\\nBased on the suggestions provided, I have updated the design for the `histogram` function as follows:\\n\\n```python\\ndef histogram(test):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Given a string representing a space separated lowercase letters, return a dictionary\\n    of the letter with the most repetition and containing the corresponding count.\\n    If several letters have the same occurrence, return all of them.\\n\\n    Additional Constraints:\\n    - The function should handle non-letter characters in the input string and should ignore them.\\n    - Empty strings should return an empty dictionary.\\n\\n    Example:\\n    histogram('a b c') == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}\\n    histogram('a b b a') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}\\n    histogram('a b c a b') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}\\n    histogram('b b b b a') == {'b': 4}\\n    histogram('') == {}\\n\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\nI have included the additional constraints for handling non-letter characters in the input string and empty strings. The function now specifies that non-letter characters should be ignored and empty strings should return an empty dictionary.\\n\\nThese updates will help provide clarity to the implementation and ensure comprehensive test coverage as recommended by the developer and tester.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef histogram(test):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Given a string representing a space separated lowercase letters, return a dictionary\\n    of the letter with the most repetition and containing the corresponding count.\\n    If several letters have the same occurrence, return all of them.\\n    \\n    Example:\\n    histogram('a b c') == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}\\n    histogram('a b b a') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}\\n    histogram('a b c a b') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}\\n    histogram('b b b b a') == {'b': 4}\\n    histogram('') == {}\\n\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
