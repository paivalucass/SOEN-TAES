    "FinalCode": "This function takes in the lengths of the three sides of a triangle and calculates the area of the triangle if the three sides form a valid triangle. If the three sides do not form a valid triangle, the function returns -1. The formula used to calculate the area of the triangle is not explicitly defined in the code, but it likely uses Heron's formula or another similar method.\n\nThe function first checks if the three sides form a valid triangle by comparing the sum of any two sides with the third side. If the condition is met, the function proceeds to calculate the area of the triangle using the given lengths. The calculated area is then rounded to 2 decimal points and returned.\n\nThe function provides examples of valid and invalid triangles to demonstrate how it works. Overall, this is a simple and straightforward function for calculating the area of a triangle."
