Break down the 'order_by_points' function into smaller, reusable functions to improve code readability and maintainability.\n2. Implement unit tests to ensure the function works as expected and to catch any potential bugs.\n\nHigh-level design for the 'order_by_points' function:\n\n```python\ndef order_by_points(nums):\n    # Define a helper function to calculate the sum of digits for a given number\n    def calculate_digit_sum(num):\n        # Implementation details for calculating the sum of digits\n        pass\n\n    # Use the helper function to calculate the sum of digits for each number in the input list\n    digit_sums = [calculate_digit_sum(num) for num in nums]\n\n    # Sort the input list based on the calculated digit sums\n    sorted_nums = [num for _, num in sorted(zip(digit_sums, nums))]\n\n    return sorted_nums\n```\n\nThis design provides a high-level structure for the 'order_by_points' function by breaking it down into smaller, reusable functions and implementing the core logic for sorting the input list based on the sum of their digits.
