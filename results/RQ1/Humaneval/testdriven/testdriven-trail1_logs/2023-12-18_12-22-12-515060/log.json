    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\nTo efficiently filter an input list of strings based on a given prefix using a data structure like a trie, we will implement the following design:\n\n1. Define a class TrieNode with the following attributes:\n   - children: a dictionary to store the children nodes\n   - is_end_of_word: a boolean value to indicate if the node represents the end of a word\n\n2. Define a function insert_word() to insert a word into the trie:\n   - Start from the root node and iterate through each character of the word\n   - For each character, check if the current node has a child node with the same character, if not create a new node\n   - Mark the last node as the end of the word\n\n3. Define a function search_prefix() to search for words with a given prefix:\n   - Start from the root node and iterate through each character of the prefix\n   - For each character, check if the current node has a child node with the same character, if not return an empty list\n   - Once the prefix is found, perform a depth-first search to collect all the words with the given prefix\n\n4. Implement the filter_by_prefix() function:\n   - Create a trie and insert all the input strings into the trie\n   - Use the search_prefix() function to retrieve the list of strings that start with the given prefix\n\nBy using a trie data structure, we can efficiently filter the input list of strings based on a given prefix. The design focuses on the high-level approach and provides guidance for the developer to implement the code without going into specific implementation details.",
    "DesignMeetings": "{\n  \"Developer\": \"The design looks good overall. However, it would be beneficial to include some error handling in the insert_word() and search_prefix() functions to handle cases where the input is invalid or the trie is empty.

Additionally, testing the filter_by_prefix() function with different input lists and prefixes to ensure accurate filtering.\"\n}",

The tests will thoroughly test the insert_word() and search_prefix() functions with various input strings and prefixes, including edge cases.
