This module will interact with a data access layer to retrieve the input list and return the result.\\n\\nHigh-level code structure:\\n```python\\ndef solution(lst):\\n    # Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.\\n    # Implementation details should go here\\n    \\n    # Example usage\\n    solution([5, 8, 7, 1])  # Expected output: 12\\n    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3])  # Expected output: 9\\n    solution([30, 13, 24, 321])  # Expected output: 0\\n```\\n\\nThe developer should focus on implementing the logic inside the `solution` function to iterate through the input list, identify odd elements in even positions, and calculate their sum. The function should handle cases where there are no odd elements in even positions by returning a sum of 0. Additionally, the algorithm should be optimized to handle large input lists without significant performance degradation.\\n\\nFurthermore, input validation and protection against potential security risks, such as buffer overflows or injection attacks, should be implemented to ensure the solution is secure and robust. Test cases should cover different scenarios, including input lists with odd elements in even positions, input lists with no odd elements in even positions, and large input lists to test performance.\", \"Question\": \"\\ndef solution(lst):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Given a non-empty list of integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.\\n    \\n\\n    Examples\\n    solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) ==> 12\\n    solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ==> 9\\n    solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) ==>0\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
