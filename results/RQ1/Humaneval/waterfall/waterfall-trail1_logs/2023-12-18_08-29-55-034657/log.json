Then, it checks if it is an alphabetical character and not a part of a word by considering the previous character. The function should handle edge cases such as punctuation and special characters by using appropriate conditional statements. Additionally, the function should include error handling for invalid input by checking if the input is a valid string before processing.\\n\\nExample:\\ncheck_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\\\"apple pie\\\") \\u27a1\\ufe0f False\\ncheck_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\\\"apple pi e\\\") \\u27a1\\ufe0f True\\ncheck_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\\\"apple pi e \\\") \\u27a1\\ufe0f False\\ncheck_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\\\"\\\") \\u27a1\\ufe0f False\\n\\nGuidelines for Developer:\\n1. Implement a function that iterates through the string from the end to find the last non-space character.\\n2. Check if it is an alphabetical character and not a part of a word by considering the previous character.\\n3. Handle edge cases such as punctuation and special characters by using appropriate conditional statements.\\n4.
