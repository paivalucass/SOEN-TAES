It will also handle edge cases where there are multiple instances of the same closest number.

It will also handle edge cases where there are multiple instances of the same closest number.\\n\\nExample Test Cases:\\n```python\\n>>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])\\n(2.0, 2.2)\\n>>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])\\n(2.0, 2.0)\\n```\\n\\nI have incorporated the suggestions to include error handling, consider using a sorted list for performance, and testing edge cases and scalability.\", \"Question\": \"from typing import List, Tuple\\n\\n\\ndef find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\" From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each\\n    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).\\n    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])\\n    (2.0, 2.2)\\n    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])\\n    (2.0, 2.0)\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\"}",
