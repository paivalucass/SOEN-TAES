The function should return the strongest extension in the format ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.\\n\\nThe algorithm for finding the strongest extension should compare the strength of each extension in the list based on the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension's name. The strength calculation should be based on the formula CAP - SM, where CAP is the number of uppercase letters and SM is the number of lowercase letters. If multiple extensions have the same strength, the function should choose the first one in the list.\\n\\nThe design should include example test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the feature, such as:\\n- Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']) == 'my_class.AA'\\n- Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'be', 'cc']) == 'my_class.be'\\n\\nThe design should also specify the constraints for the class name and extension names, such as allowing only alphanumeric characters. Additionally, the design should specify the expected behavior in case of invalid input, such as non-alphanumeric characters in the class name or extension names.\\n\\nFurthermore, the design should include details about error handling and edge cases, such as what should happen if the list of extensions is empty or if the class name contains special characters. It should guide the developer in handling these scenarios when implementing the Strongest Extension Finder feature.\\n\\nOverall, the design should provide a high-level overview of the feature's functionality, input parameters, output format, algorithm for finding the strongest extension, example test cases, constraints, error handling, and edge cases.
