    "FinalCode": "The given code is a Python function that checks whether a given number is a perfect square or not. The function definition is provided, and it includes a docstring with a link to a resource for more information.\n\nThe function uses the 'assert' statement to test whether the function returns the expected result for a specific input. In this case, it asserts that the function should not identify 10 as a perfect square.\n\nTo improve the code, it would be helpful to include the actual implementation of the 'is_perfect_square' function, as it is currently missing from the provided code snippet. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more test cases to thoroughly validate the function's correctness."
