    "FinalCode": "This is a Python function that uses regular expressions to match a string that has an 'a' followed by one or more 'b's. The function is designed to return True if the condition is met, and False otherwise. The function also includes a link to the source of the exercise for reference. Additionally, there is an assertion that tests the function with the input \"ac\" and expects the result to be False."
