To achieve this, we can suggest using regular expressions for efficient extraction.

The extracted values should then be returned as a list.\n\nHere's a high-level design for the function:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_values(text):\n    pattern = r'\"(.*?)\"'  # Regular expression pattern to match values between quotation marks\n    return re.findall(pattern, text)  # Use re.findall to extract values and return them as a list\n```\n\nBy using regular expressions, the developer can efficiently achieve the required functionality of extracting values between quotation marks from a string.
