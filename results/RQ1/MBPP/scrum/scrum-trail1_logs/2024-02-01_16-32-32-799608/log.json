We can also consider using data generators to create large input sizes for testing purposes. Additionally, we should validate the expected output for the test case 'Test with array of all identical elements', as the current expected output may not be correct based on the function's logic. Finally, we should ensure that the code coverage includes handling edge cases such as empty arrays and when k is equal to the length of the array.\\\"\\n}\\n # Draft Test cases:\\n{\\n  \\\"Test_Cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test_Title\\\": \\\"Test efficiency and accuracy of reverse_Array_Upto_K function\\\",\\n      \\\"Input_Data\\\": \\\"arr=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], k=4\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected_Output\\\": \\\"[4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test_Title\\\": \\\"Test with empty array\\\",\\n      \\\"Input_Data\\\": \\\"arr=[], k=0\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected_Output\\\": \\\"[]\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test_Title\\\": \\\"Test with array of all identical elements\\\",\\n      \\\"Input_Data\\\": \\\"arr=[5, 5, 5, 5, 5], k=3\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected_Output\\\": \\\"[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test_Title\\\": \\\"Test with large input size\\\",\\n      \\\"Input_Data\\\": \\\"arr=[1, 2, 3, ..., 1000000], k=500000\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected_Output\\\": \\\"[500000, ..., 3, 2, 1, ..., 1000000]\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test_Title\\\": \\\"Test reversing up to the first position\\\",\\n      \\\"Input_Data\\\": \\\"arr=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=0\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected_Output\\\": \\\"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test_Title\\\": \\\"Test reversing up to the last position\\\",\\n      \\\"Input_Data\\\": \\\"arr=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k=5\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected_Output\\\": \\\"[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction.
