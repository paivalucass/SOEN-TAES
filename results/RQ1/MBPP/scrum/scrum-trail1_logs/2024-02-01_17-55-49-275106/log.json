The function will then calculate the lateral surface area using the formula 2 * \u03c0 * r * h.\n\nIt is important to note that we should consider the use of existing libraries or frameworks for this calculation. In this case, we should research existing libraries or frameworks for calculating the lateral surface area of a cylinder. If there are reliable and well-maintained libraries available for this purpose, we should consider using them to avoid reinventing the wheel.\n\nThe high-level design for the function can be outlined as follows:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef lateral_surface_cylinder(r, h):\n    '''\n    Calculate the lateral surface area of a cylinder.\n    \n    Args:\n    r (float): Radius of the cylinder\n    h (float): Height of the cylinder\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: Lateral surface area of the cylinder\n    '''\n    return 2 * math.pi * r * h\n```\n\nThis design provides a clear and concise function that can be used by developers to implement the requirement.
