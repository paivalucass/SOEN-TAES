Consider using efficient data structures and algorithms to achieve this.\n\nError Handling:\n- The function should handle input validation to ensure that the input is a valid string of digits.\n\nGuidance for Developer:\n- The developer should focus on writing a clean and efficient algorithm to calculate the sum of digits and count the number of substrings with the sum equal to their length. Consider using appropriate data structures and iteration techniques to achieve the desired functionality.\n\nExample Test Case:\n- Input: '112112'\n- Output: 6\n\nThe developer should ensure that the function produces the correct output for the provided example test case and also handle other edge cases effectively.",
