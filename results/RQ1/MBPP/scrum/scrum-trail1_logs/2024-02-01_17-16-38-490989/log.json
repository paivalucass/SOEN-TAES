I also want to plan for potential impact on the user experience when implementing this functionality. To implement the functionality described in the user story, we can consider using a two-pointer approach where one pointer starts from the beginning of the array and moves forward to find negative elements, while the other pointer starts from the end of the array and moves backward to find positive elements. Once the pointers identify a negative element and a positive element, we can swap them to maintain the relative order. This approach will preserve the relative order among the negative and positive elements. Additionally, we need to consider the potential impact on the user experience and ensure that the re-arrangement of elements does not disrupt the user interface or functionality. When testing the functionality, we should create test cases to cover various scenarios such as arrays with all negative elements, all positive elements, mix of negative and positive elements, empty array, and large input arrays. We should also test edge cases such as when the value of n is 0, equal to the length of the array, or greater than the length of the array. Additionally, we need to test the impact on the user experience by checking for any disruption in the user interface or unexpected behavior after re-arranging the elements.\\\"\\n}\\n# Tasks:\\n['Write test cases for different scenarios', 'Cover cases of all negative, all positive, and mixed negative and positive elements']\\n# Design:\\n```python\\ndef re_arrange_array(arr, n):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    Write a function that takes in an array and an integer n, and re-arranges the first n elements of the given array so that all negative elements appear before positive ones, and where the relative order among negative and positive elements is preserved.\\n    Args:\\n    - arr: input array\\n    - n: integer indicating the number of elements to re-arrange\\n    Returns:\\n    - re-arranged array\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    # Implement the two-pointer approach to re-arrange the elements in the array\\n    left = 0\\n    right = n - 1\\n\\n    while left <= right:\\n        if arr[left] < 0:\\n            left += 1\\n        elif arr[right] >= 0:\\n            right -= 1\\n        else:\\n            arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]\\n            left += 1\\n            right -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\", \"Question\": \"def re_arrange_array(arr, n):\\n'''Write a function that takes in an array and an integer n, and re-arranges the first n elements of the given array so that all negative elements appear before positive ones, and where the relative order among negative and positive elements is preserved.\\nassert re_arrange_array([-1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, 8, 9], 9) == [-1, -3, -7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9]'''\\n\"}",
