Data Structures:\n   - The algorithm will make use of basic data structures such as integers and lists for storing and manipulating the numbers and prime numbers.\n\n3. Modular Design:\n   - The python function count_Primes_nums(n) will be broken down into smaller, modular functions to improve maintainability and reusability.\n   - Each modular function will handle a specific part of the algorithm, such as prime number testing, iteration, and counting.\n\n4. Performance Optimization:\n   - We will implement a caching mechanism to improve the performance of the function for repetitive inputs. This can be achieved by storing previously calculated results for specific inputs.\n\n5. Testing:\n   - Comprehensive test cases will be created to cover different scenarios such as valid input, edge cases, and invalid input.\n   - Boundary value analysis will also be performed to identify any potential boundary-related issues.\n\nBy following this design, the developer will be guided to implement a well-structured and efficient python function for counting prime numbers less than a given non-negative number.",
