If it does, increment its occurrence count. If not, add it to the dictionary with an occurrence count of 1.\n- Finally, return the dictionary containing the unique sublists as keys and their occurrences as values.\n\nExample:\n```python\ndef unique_sublists(list1):\n    unique_counts = {}\n    for sublist in list1:\n        sublist_tuple = tuple(sublist)\n        if sublist_tuple in unique_counts:\n            unique_counts[sublist_tuple] += 1\n        else:\n            unique_counts[sublist_tuple] = 1\n    return unique_counts\n\nassert unique_sublists([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]]) == {(1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1}\n```\n\nNote: This design provides a high-level approach to solving the requirement and guides the developer on how to structure the code and logic without providing specific implementation details.",
