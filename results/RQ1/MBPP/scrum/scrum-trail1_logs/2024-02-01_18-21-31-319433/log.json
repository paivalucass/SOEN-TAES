    "DesignDraft0": "Design:\n\nTo fulfill the requirement of creating a data structure to track unique tuples and iterate through the list to count them, I propose the following high-level design:\n\n1. Data Structure:\n   - Use a dictionary to track unique tuples as keys and their frequency as values.\n   - Iterate through the input list and populate the dictionary with unique tuples and their frequency.\n\n2. Function:\n   - Write a function named \"extract_freq\" that takes the input list as a parameter.\n   - Inside the function, create a dictionary to store the unique tuples and their frequency.\n   - Iterate through the input list and update the dictionary accordingly.\n   - Return the count of unique tuples.\n\n3. Code Guidance:\n   - Provide clear documentation for the function, including input parameter description and expected output.\n   - Use meaningful variable names and comments to guide the developer through the implementation.\n   - Focus on the algorithmic approach to efficiently track unique tuples and count them, rather than specific implementation details.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\ndef extract_freq(test_list):\n    '''\n    Write a function to extract the number of unique tuples in the given list.\n    assert extract_freq([(3, 4), (1, 2), (4, 3), (5, 6)] ) == 3\n    '''\n    unique_tuples = {}\n    for item in test_list:\n        if item in unique_tuples:\n            unique_tuples[item] += 1\n        else:\n            unique_tuples[item] = 1\n    return len(unique_tuples)\n```\n\nThis design provides a high-level approach to creating a data structure and implementing a function to extract the number of unique tuples in the given list.
