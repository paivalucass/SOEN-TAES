The function should account for the possibility that the input arrays may or may not be sorted.\n\n3.

Specific test cases should be included to verify the functionality of the intersection_array function with different input arrays and varying lengths and element types. This will ensure that the function performs as expected under different scenarios.\n\nBased on these guidelines, the developer can write a function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef intersection_array(array_nums1, array_nums2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function to find the intersection of two arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Implementation of the function\n```\n\nAdditionally, the developer should include an assertion to test the function as follows:\n\n```python\nassert intersection_array([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10], [1, 2, 4, 8, 9]) == [1, 2, 8, 9]\n```\n\nThis will guide the developer in writing the code for the intersection_array function while focusing on high-level design and test cases.",
