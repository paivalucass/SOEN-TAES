Further investigation and debugging are required to identify and fix the issue.\n\nCode:\ndef maxAverageOfPath(cost):\n    N = len(cost)\n    dp = [0] * N\n    \n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                dp[j] = cost[i][j]\n            elif i == 0:\n                dp[j] = (dp[j - 1] * j + cost[i][j]) / (j + 1)\n            elif j == 0:\n                dp[j] = (dp[j] * i + cost[i][j]) / (i + 1)\n            else:\n                dp[j] = max(dp[j - 1], dp[j]) + cost[i][j]\n    \n    return dp[-1] / (2 * N - 1)\n\nRecommendation:\nThe code needs to be reviewed and modified to ensure that it produces the expected output for the given input.
