We should also validate the input data to ensure it contains valid list structures. For the 'Lists of different lengths' test case, we should handle the scenario where the input lists have different lengths and ensure the algorithm is able to handle it properly. For the 'Lists with all identical items' test case, we should verify that the algorithm correctly identifies all identical items and returns the expected output.\\\"\\n}\\n # Draft Test cases:\\n{\\n  \\\"test_cases\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Empty input lists\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"list1=[], list2=[], list3=[]\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": 0\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Lists of different lengths\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"list1=[1,2,3], list2=[4,5], list3=[6,7,8]\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": 0\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"Test Title\\\": \\\"Lists with all identical items\\\",\\n      \\\"Input Data\\\": \\\"list1=[1,1,1], list2=[1,1,1], list3=[1,1,1]\\\",\\n      \\\"Expected Output\\\": 3\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction.
