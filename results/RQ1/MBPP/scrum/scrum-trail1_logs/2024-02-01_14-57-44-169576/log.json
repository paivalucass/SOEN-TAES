It also utilizes dynamic programming techniques to efficiently solve the problem. Additionally, the function has clear and descriptive variable names to improve readability and maintainability. Test cases have been added to cover different scenarios such as valid inputs, invalid inputs, and edge cases. The function has also been tested with large input values to check for efficiency and performance.\", \"Question\": \"def get_total_number_of_sequences(m,n): \\n'''Write a function that takes in positive integers m and n and finds the number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m.\\nassert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4'''\\n\"}",
