This will make the code more modular and easier to maintain. Additionally, I want to include error handling for cases where the input parameter is not a valid length for the side of a cube. I also want to write test cases for the surfacearea_cube function to cover different scenarios, such as positive and negative input values, zero input value, and edge cases. It's important to ensure that the function returns the correct surface area for different input values and handles invalid input gracefully.\\\"\\n \\t\\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n \\t\\n# Tasks:\\n['Test function with different input sizes', 'Ensure accurate calculation of surface area']\\n# Design:\\nDesign:\\n\\n- Create a separate class or module called SurfaceAreaCalculator to encapsulate the logic for calculating the surface area of a cube.\\n- The class should have a method called calculate_surface_area_cube() that takes the length of the side of the cube as a parameter.\\n- Implement error handling code within the calculate_surface_area_cube() method to check for valid input length and handle invalid input gracefully.\\n- Write test cases to cover positive and negative input values, zero input value, and edge cases for the calculate_surface_area_cube() method.\\n- Ensure that the method returns the correct surface area for different input values and handles invalid input gracefully.\\n\\nHigh-level code structure:\\n```python\\nclass SurfaceAreaCalculator:\\n    def calculate_surface_area_cube(self, length):\\n        # Implement error handling code to check for valid input length\\n        # Calculate surface area of the cube\\n        pass\\n\\n# Test cases\\ndef test_surface_area_cube():\\n    # Test cases for positive and negative input values, zero input value, and edge cases\\n    assert surfacearea_cube(5) == 150\\n```\", \"Question\": \"def surfacearea_cube(l):\\n'''Write a function to find the surface area of a cube of a given size.\\nassert surfacearea_cube(5)==150'''\\n\"}",
