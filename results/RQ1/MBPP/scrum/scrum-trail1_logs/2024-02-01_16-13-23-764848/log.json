The function should be named swap_List and should have the following signature:\n\n```python\ndef swap_List(newList):\n```\nThe function should be implemented to perform the interchange of the first and last elements in the input list. The implementation should include error handling for cases where the input list is empty or has only one element. The function should return a new list with the interchange performed.\n\nAdditionally, the function should include a set of test scenarios to ensure thorough testing of the swap_List functionality. The test scenarios should cover cases with different types of input lists, including empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with multiple elements. The expected outcomes for each test scenario should be clearly documented to ensure comprehensive testing of the functionality.\n\nArchitectural design and considerations for the swap_List functionality should include a section for system components, data flow, and the technology stack to be used for implementing the functionality. This section should provide high-level guidance for the developer on how the functionality should fit into the overall system architecture and the technologies that should be leveraged for its implementation.\n\nOverall, the design should focus on guiding the developer in writing the code for the swap_List functionality, providing high-level architectural considerations and test scenarios, rather than delving into specific implementation details.",
