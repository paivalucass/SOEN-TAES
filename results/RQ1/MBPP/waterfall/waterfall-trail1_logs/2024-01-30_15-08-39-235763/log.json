Function Name:\\n   - calculate_odd_powers_sum\\n\\n2. Input Parameter:\\n   - n: An integer representing the count of odd natural numbers to consider.\\n\\n3. Functionality:\\n   - Calculate the fourth power of each odd natural number from 1 to n.\\n   - Find the sum of these fourth powers.\\n   - Return the sum as the output.\\n\\n4. Non-Functional Requirements:\\n   - Language: The function should be implemented in Python programming language.\\n   - Efficiency: The function should be optimized for performance when handling large values of n by using a more efficient algorithm to calculate the fourth power of odd natural numbers.\\n   - Input Validation: Validate the input parameter n to ensure it is a positive integer and within specified constraints.\\n   - Error Handling: Handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of the function.\\n   - Constraints: Specify the maximum allowed value for the input parameter n.\\n\\n5. Test Cases:\\n   - Test Case 1: Input n=2, Expected Output 82.\\n   - Test Case 2: Input n=3, Expected Output 408.\\n   - Test Case 3: Input n=5, Expected Output 2058.\\n   - Additional Test Cases: Include more test cases with different input values to cover a wider range of scenarios, including edge cases and boundary values. Specify the expected outputs for each test case to facilitate accurate testing.\\n\\nThis updated design addresses the suggestions for improved function name, input parameter validation, efficiency, comprehensive test cases, and clear input validation, error handling, and constraints.\", \"Question\": \"def odd_num_sum(n) : \\n'''Write a python function to find the sum of fourth power of first n odd natural numbers.\\nassert odd_num_sum(2) == 82'''\\n\"}",
