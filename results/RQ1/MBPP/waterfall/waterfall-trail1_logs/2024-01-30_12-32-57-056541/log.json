Create an empty list to store the converted elements.\\n  2. Iterate through each sub-list in the input test_list\\n  3. Within each sub-list, iterate through each element\\n  4. Convert the element to float if possible and append to the new sub-list\\n  5. Append the new sub-list to the converted_list\\n  6. Return the converted_list\\n\\n- Input Requirements:\\n  - The input should be a list of lists.\\n  - It should handle both integer and string representations of numbers.\\n  - It should specify the expected behavior for edge cases, such as an empty list or lists with non-numeric elements.\\n  - Error handling should be added for cases where the input is not a list of lists.\\n\\n- Output Requirements:\\n  - The output should be a list of lists with elements converted to floats.\\n  - It should return the converted list of lists.\\n\\n- Performance and Scalability Requirements:\\n  - The function should handle large input lists efficiently.\\n  - It should have optimal time complexity for the conversion process, such as using generator expressions or list comprehension for efficient iteration and conversion.\\n  - Test cases should be created for different scenarios including empty input lists, lists with non-numeric elements, and large input lists to ensure the function handles them correctly.\\n  - Performance testing with large input lists should be conducted to ensure it meets the scalability requirements.\\n\\nNote: The high-level design now includes error handling for non-list inputs, performance optimizations for large input lists, and additional test cases for different scenarios and performance testing.\", \"Question\": \"def list_to_float(test_list):\\n'''Write a function to convert all possible convertible elements in a list of lists to floats.\\nassert list_to_float( [(\\\"3\\\", \\\"4\\\"), (\\\"1\\\", \\\"26.45\\\"), (\\\"7.32\\\", \\\"8\\\"), (\\\"4\\\", \\\"8\\\")] ) == [(3.0, 4.0), (1.0, 26.45), (7.32, 8.0), (4.0, 8.0)]'''\\n\"}",
