This function takes the following parameters:\\n- arr: The input array on which rotations will be performed.\\n- ranges: A list of rotation ranges.\\n- rotations: The number of rotations to be performed.\\n- index: The specified index for which the element needs to be found.\\n\\nThe function performs the specified number of rotations on the input array according to the given ranges. After the rotations, it returns the element at the specified index.\\n\\nTo ensure efficiency with a time complexity of O(n) or better, the function is implemented using efficient algorithms for performing rotations and finding the element at the specified index. It also handles edge cases such as empty arrays and invalid input ranges gracefully, and specifies the expected behavior when the index is out of bounds.\\n\\nI have provided more details on the expected size of the input arrays and rotation ranges, as well as constraints on the input values to meet the efficiency requirement.\\n\\nThe testing covers various input scenarios, including edge cases such as empty arrays, invalid rotation ranges, and out of bounds index, in addition to performance testing to validate the time complexity requirement. Test cases that cover a wide range of input array and rotation range sizes have also been included for thorough testing.\", \"Question\": \"def find_Element(arr,ranges,rotations,index) :  \\n'''Write a python function to find element at a given index after number of rotations.\\nassert find_Element([1,2,3,4,5],[[0,2],[0,3]],2,1) == 3'''\\n\"}",
