Define a function sum_series(n) that takes a parameter 'n' and calculates the sum of (n - 2*i) from i=0 to n // 2.\\n2. Use a loop to iterate through the series and calculate the sum, ensuring efficiency and optimizing memory usage and performance.\\n3. Handle edge cases such as when 'n' is an odd number and when 'n' is a negative number using conditional statements.\\n4. Utilize efficient data structures like arrays or lists to store the series elements and calculate the sum.\\n5. Include type checking to handle non-integer parameters and string inputs.\\n6. Write assertion tests using a testing framework like pytest to ensure the function returns the correct result.\\n7. Test the function with various input values including odd and negative numbers, large input sizes, non-integer parameters, and string inputs to verify handling of edge cases and performance.\\n\\nCode:\\n```python\\ndef sum_series(n):\\n    '''Write a function to calculate the sum (n - 2*i) from i=0 to n // 2, for instance n + (n-2) + (n-4)...
