The function should take polar coordinates (r, theta) as input and return rectangular coordinates (x, y). The function should also include assertions to validate the correctness of the conversion by comparing it with pre-defined values. The function should be designed to handle edge cases such as when the input polar coordinates are close to the origin or when theta is close to 0 or 2*pi. Also, consider implementing the function in a way that it can be easily reused or extended for future enhancements. Test cases should cover a wide range of input values for polar coordinates to ensure the function produces accurate results. Also, create test cases specifically for the assertion validations to make sure they are working as expected.\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n# Design:\\nBased on the suggestions provided by the developer and tester, I have updated the design to include input validation and proper error handling for cases where r is negative or theta is not within the range [0, 2*pi].
