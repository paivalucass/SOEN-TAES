It also handles the case where k is equal to the length of the list by removing the last element.\\n- If k is within the range, it creates a new list by concatenating the elements before and after the k'th element, effectively removing the k'th element.\\n- The new list is then returned as the result.\\n- The function includes a detailed docstring explaining its purpose, input arguments, and return value.\\n- The function also includes an assertion test case to validate its functionality.\", \"Question\": \"def remove_kth_element(list1, L):\\n'''Write a python function which takes a list and returns a list with the same elements, but the k'th element removed.\\nassert remove_kth_element([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)==[1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]'''\\n\"}",
