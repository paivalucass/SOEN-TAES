The function now iterates through the list and checks for the presence of the substring in each string value. As for the suggestion from the tester to add test cases, I have included test cases to cover various scenarios such as empty string list, empty substring, substring present in multiple string values, substring not present in any string value, etc. This ensures the robustness and correctness of the function.\", \"Question\": \"def find_substring(str1, sub_str):\\n'''Write a function to check if a string is present as a substring in a given list of string values.\\nassert find_substring([\\\"red\\\", \\\"black\\\", \\\"white\\\", \\\"green\\\", \\\"orange\\\"],\\\"ack\\\")==True'''\\n\"}",
