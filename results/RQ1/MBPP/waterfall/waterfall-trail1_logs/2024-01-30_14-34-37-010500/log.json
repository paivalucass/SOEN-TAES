Assertion Tests:\\n   - Include multiple assertion tests to cover different scenarios, such as an empty input dictionary, a dictionary with only one key-value pair, and a dictionary with the expected number of unique values.\\n6. Additional Considerations:\\n   - Include clear documentation about the expected behavior in different scenarios, including empty input dictionary or a dictionary with only one key-value pair.\\n\\nBy following these suggestions, the function will have a more descriptive name, a more efficient algorithm using a set to store unique values, and comprehensive assertion tests to cover different scenarios.\", \"Question\": \"def check_value(dict, n):\\n'''Write a function to check if all values are same in a dictionary.\\nassert check_value({'Cierra Vega': 12, 'Alden Cantrell': 12, 'Kierra Gentry': 12, 'Pierre Cox': 12},10)==False'''\\n\"}",
