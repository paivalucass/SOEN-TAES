The function should be designed to handle both positive and negative numbers, as well as zero, and be able to handle a large number of input numbers in the list.\n\nOne possible high-level design for the sum_of_digits function could be as follows:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(nums):\n    # Function to compute the sum of digits of each number in the given list\n    total_sum = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        total_sum += get_digit_sum(num)\n    return total_sum\n\ndef get_digit_sum(num):\n    # Function to compute the sum of digits of a single number\n    # Implementation details for handling positive, negative, and zero numbers, as well as a large number of input numbers, will be provided in the function body.\n    pass\n```\n\nThis design separates the task of computing the sum of digits for each number into smaller, reusable components, as requested in the requirement. The get_digit_sum function can be implemented with the necessary logic to handle the constraints and test cases mentioned in the context.\n\nBy providing this high-level design, the developer will have a clear guidance on how to structure the code for the sum_of_digits function in a modular and maintainable way.",
    "DesignMeetings": "{\n  \"Developer\": \"The high-level design for the sum_of_digits function looks good, but we should consider adding input validation to handle cases where the input is not a list or if the list contains non-numeric values.
