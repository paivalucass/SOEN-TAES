    "DesignDraft": "Design:\n\nI recommend breaking down the python function into smaller modular functions to improve code reusability and maintainability. The main function, number_ctr, should focus on the high-level logic of counting digits in a given string. Additionally, the use of regular expressions can efficiently count the number of digits in the given string.\n\nHere is a high-level design for the function:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_digits(str):\n    pattern = r'\\d'\n    digit_count = len(re.findall(pattern, str))\n    return digit_count\n\ndef number_ctr(str):\n    '''Write a python function to count number of digits in a given string.'''\n    return count_digits(str)\n\n# Test case\nassert number_ctr('program2bedone') == 1\n```\n\nThe count_digits function can be utilized to specifically handle the logic of counting digits within the string. This approach promotes code reusability and maintainability by separating concerns and allowing for easier testing. Additionally, the use of regular expressions provides an efficient method for counting the number of digits in the given string.",
