The function should return a boolean value indicating whether the expression is balanced or not.\n\nThe logic for checking balanced parentheses should be implemented using a stack data structure. The function should iterate through the characters of the input expression and push opening parentheses onto the stack. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the function should pop the top element from the stack and compare it with the current closing parenthesis. If they do not match, the function should return False immediately. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, the function should return True, indicating that the expression is balanced.\n\nError handling should be included to handle edge cases such as empty input or expressions with only one type of parentheses. Additionally, the function should include test cases for both balanced and unbalanced expressions, including boundary conditions and special cases as specified in the requirement document.\n\nThe function should be well-documented to explain its purpose and usage.
