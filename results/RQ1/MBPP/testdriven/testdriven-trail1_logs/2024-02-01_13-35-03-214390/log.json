Test cases should be designed to cover scenarios such as valid input, invalid input data type, invalid index value, and tuple index out of range. It's also important to check for any potential edge cases and boundary conditions. Additionally, the code should be tested for performance and scalability, especially for large input tuples.\\\"\\n}\\n# Original code:\\ndef colon_tuplex(tuplex, m, n):\\n    if not isinstance(tuplex, tuple):\\n        raise TypeError(\\\"Input data type is not a tuple\\\")\\n    \\n    if not isinstance(m, int) or m < 0:\\n        raise TypeError(\\\"Invalid index value\\\")\\n    \\n    if m > len(tuplex):\\n        raise IndexError(\\\"Tuple index out of range\\\")\\n    \\n    result = list(tuplex)\\n    result.insert(m, n)\\n    \\n    return tuple(result)\", \"Question\": \"Follow the Instruction section.
